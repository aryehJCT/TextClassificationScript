the holidays god. we all hate them. you know you do, dont deny it. the food. the family. the people. the FAT. UGH! so obviously. im on vacation. two weeks. two weeks without structure, school, and starvation. since im home so much i need to eat more to satisfy my family‚Äôs suspicions. it sucks. and now, im writting to you wonderful people who read my blog from my aunts house. there are TOO MANY PEOPLE HERE! its me, my sister, my brother, my mom, my dad, my grandma, aunt 1, uncle 1, aunt 2, uncle 2, cousin 1, cousin 1‚Äôs husband, and their kid (second cousin).yeah. i managed not to eat too much for most of the day. and then desert came and aunt 2 brought a whole platter full of different types of cookies and there was aunt 1‚Äôs toffe brittle, and just so many delicious sugary things. i caved, i had to have eaten like 8 cookies and 3 square inches of toffee brittle. i feel FREAKING DISGUCTING. i want to go in the bathroom and cry my eyes out. i hate feeling this full. i hate it so much. iv been trying to exercise by bouncing my legs and walking around, but im pretty sure its not working. i guess i just need a little support right now. ALSO. i made a post on whyeat.net about how researchers believe that anorexia is linked to wanting to stay a child, and im starting to agree with that more and more. my seconds cousin got all these presents and everyone was paying attention to him and i felt jealous. of a freaking five year old! i wanted to be the center of everyones attention. i wanted everyone to be taking my picture. i wanted all the presents. these days everyone just gets me like 15 bucks and then theyre done with me. its not fair. either that or i want to fade away. disappear so im just a spectator. im free to leave whenever i want to but i can always come back and enjoy the company thats close by. i just want this to end. i hate holidays.
I'm Back... Hey guys, Thank you for all your kind words! Thought I might put a little something as i'm feeling a bit more optimistic! Yesterday I lost 2lbs, because I had half a roast chicken sandwich and a handful of grapes, and did a 4 mile run- soooo proud of myself! So today me and the bf are having a summer salad out in the garden cause it is just such dreamy weather, so hopefully that i'll help keep the lbs off! I now know how much support I have on here, and hopefully I can regain my blogging routine. Strawberry, I eat oranges instead cause I despise grapefruit! Faaaaar to sour for my liking! And tuna is a god in disguise! ;) and yeah I'm going to try and have a lot more steamed broccoli and cauliflower if I get hunger pangs. But recently I'm just not feeling hungry! Today I had a petit filous and the other half of the sandwich from yesterday, so I'm doing well. I just keep thinking, don't! because you will hate yourself tomorrow. Thank you so much for everything :) Here's some summer thinpso for you all to enjoy :) Xxx

So, I got on the scale last night and my heart practically leaped out of my chest. 111.6!!! A new low! Using the energy from my absolute elation, I went straight from my shower into my crunches and practically passed out in bed. The next morning, I weighed myself again and BOOM!!! 109.5 I cannot remember the last time I was this happy! I‚Äôm almost able to forget my doctor‚Äôs appointment today. Almost. I got a new water enhancer called Mio Energy and I think it‚Äôs what helped me drop those extra pounds. It has no calories, but is sweet so it helps quell sugar cravings. It also passes through you like tea so it gives me a sense of temporary heaviness, not permanent weight like normal water does. It also has vitamins in it, so that‚Äôs good üôÇ I am so unbelievably happy, you have NO CLUE. I was honestly worried that I would never be able to drop below 113, and I almost started crying when I saw that beautiful number on the scale. I am one step closer to my ultimate goal weight üôÇ And it‚Äôs a damn big step ‚ù§ Stay Strong and Skinny, My Lovelies üôÇ ~Robin ‚ù§
Hey darlings. And by darlings I mean Bella I think you're the only one who reads this. I'm having a bit of a crisis but I'm back from up North now. I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and I haven't been taking the new antidepressants he gave me because a massive side effect was weight gain. And I've gone so downhill, and I feel like shit and I wrote a list of all the things I need to say to him, everything I feel and the biggest things that scare me but I don't know if I'm brave enough to give it to him. I'm too shy, I just let my doctor talk and lie and pretend I take my meds when I don't and I want help so bad but I'm so scared. Sorry it a self obsessed rant. I hope you're okay. 
How to cut calories in everyday baking This isn't so much a recipe, but more a tip to apply with any recipe. Queenie asked me if I had any low-calorie cake recipes, and while I don't, I do have experience testing to see what's the best balance between fat content and final product. First of all, never cut all the fat from a cake! It's crucial to have some fat content to produce a proper texture. I'm going to fill you all in on my favourite ways to cut calories in cakes, and baking in general. Keep at least an egg yolk or a little oil in there - I prefer to use a low-fat margarine, with fat-free milk, fat-free egg replacer, and low-calorie sweetener. Skim Milk This is an obvious one. Just replace equal amounts full-fat milk with skim milk, and you'll cut calories. Low-Fat Margarine Spreads The lowest calorie one that I've been able to find is Weight Watcher's Canola Spread, which has 300 less calories per 125g than butter. I use this in my baking all the time, and have had no issues. I've tried using Applesauce, but it tends to give cakes a gummy, unpleasant, chewy texture. Artificial/Low Calorie Sweetener Again, an obvious one. Cutting a cup of sugar in favor of Splenda saves 700 calories! Vegan Egg Replacer For some reason, I have much better results with this than with egg whites. I use Orgran No Egg. One teaspoon is equal to one egg, but only 9 calories. In a two-egg recipe, this cuts 130 calories. Diet Soda This is not a method I'd recommend, but it works in a pinch. Get a box of cake mix (low-sugar is best, for lower calories) and mix it up with a can of diet soda. These tend to turn out with the same unpleasant texture as using applesauce, but not everyone minds. Cake Flour This doesn't cut calories, but it's just a handy tip. Especially when you're cutting fat from a cake, Cake Flour will produce a more tender cake, as it has a different protein content. It's worth getting if you can find it, or you can find recipes for making your own (like self-raising flour). I hope that these help you guys with your baking endeavors! Happy Eating! xxBella
LOOKING FOR HELP?   Um..hey everyone. I'm new here and don't know much, I came here in hopes of getting some support on my endeavor to lose. I used to be really skinny when I first came to America, however life here became very stressful and busy that when I entered high school I gained a great amount of weight. I also went into a bit of depression and became extremely introverted and still am. I'm 17 now and entering my second year in college, I tried dieting as was suggested, before than I weighted 132lbs and only lost 4lbs and was extremely disappointed. I despise everything about my body, especially my legs and thighs. I'm now 128lbs and hope to get to 108lbs of possible. I would extremely appreciate any motivation, ideas, and tips that anyone can offer. I also hope to possibly get a pen-pal who can encourage me when things get tough as well as keep me in check. I would also love to do the same, we could encourage and help each other. Please let me know if anyone's interested. If anyone's interested in being pen-pals please msg: Email-Winterz.18.lost@gmail.com Kik-gothique829
I went back to my therapist and I actually managed to tell him I've wanted to die, every day for the last few months. He finally seems to be taking me a bit more seriously. He seemed understanding, I'm going back weekly for a while. He even booked me in for appointments after my 18th birthday which I don't think he's allowed to do since it's a child and adolescent clinic, but he said he's scared to let me disappear at least until after my exams. For the evening before my appointment and a lot of the day I was in an unexpected good mood, I actually saw some hope and a purpose in life. Then out of nowhere in the evening I lost my mind. I'm trying not to cut anymore since it's summer soon, so I went mental punching every inch of my body but it didn't hurt enough. I settled for trying to break my arm by beating it with various hard objects. I didn't break it, but today I have the most disgusting bruise it hurts to brush up against anything. I really don't know what triggered it. I've never been that crazy before. I have history coursework due in tomorrow (well technically it was due months ago, my teacher's extended my deadline to literally hours before the exams board will want it sent off). I doubt I'll get it down. All I want to do right now is cry and sleep forever. But I can't let her down again. She's been too nice about it. I can't turn up empty handed. I'm such a worthless idiotic bitch.
Blah So I'm noT losing anything what the hell? Day 3 fruit and veg today but my scales has not shifted!  Bit annoyed really, tonight we have "friends" coming over, I really cbf!! I just wanna go home and relax not go home and put up with idiots! I sound horrible but I just don't feel like having em round especially coz of who it is. Nothing else to say, no weightless, no gain, no nothing!  On another note I'm starting to hate this app, I can't comment on posts I can't see everyone's profile properly, I can't follow new ppl & I don't have a dash bored!!!
sympathy for the devil I have finally cracked it! I'm lying in bed clutching at my stomach and have the biggest smile on my face because I'm back to where I should be. I can feel my belly tingling like little bells are rocking against the insides and ringing out the sound of success, of beauty and control and everything else. And I have no desire to eat at all.  I have been trying something different this time. Before, I could go straight from normal to 500 calories a day without any slow descent. My recent binging (that has been going on since 1 January!) is going to require a bit more of a downgrading, particularly seeing as I didn't put on any weight from eating takeaways and chocolate like it was going out of fashion due to a lot of exercise and sea kelp. I have been so busy at work that I don't really have enough time to eat much anymore. I have a slice of toast in the morning, copious amounts of tea and coffee throughout the day, a salad or soup for lunch, followed by perhaps some crisps, and then whatever my parents make for dinner. I am still mostly eat dinner at the moment. I skip it only once or twice a week: slow descents. I take any excuse at work to walk to other departments and rooms, fidgeting, fidgeting, fidgeting constantly. I haven't weighed myself for the past couple of days. I got my period on Friday which would explain why I was 119lbs, but that's also quite a promising sign. I will be 114lbs by the end of the week. Two people called me tiny on Saturday night. What a lovely word! A little misplaced right now but it will sound better next to my name soon enough.  I have a date tomorrow night. Another excuse to skip dinner!
Its hard I fasted for a total of 66hours drank soo much water and have lost 1.6lbs :) I know I could've lost more but I weighed after I ate instead of before, mainly because my scales are messed up and keep messing with me saying 160lbs 165lbs until it finally showed me 170lbs like 10 times yesterday... Aghh its hard my boyfriend is like why aren't you eating?  I said I ate at work and hes obviously shocked Im handling 5mins without stuffing my face he says hes worried...?  Like how am I supposed to do this if I cant even last 3days without someone forcing me to eat.... And I still haven't started my course and im still fat and im so annoyed I said I wouldn't allow myself and look at me now fat face chest belly bums & legs I hate it all . I did buy my B6 & B12 though they are the only thing keeping me awake I want to sleep but instead im gonna do pilates and jumping jacks and crunches until 10pm so I can shower and hide my exercise evidence before the boyfriend gets home @ 11pm. I was reading blogs I followed before and so much has changed most of you are gone some have sadly passed...but the ones that are still here and still going you are my motivation everyday and I will get down to my GW. No matter what.
She ridicules your body and it's size, She spills out all of these ridiculous lies. Nothing that she's saying, Matches with your weighing. You're tiny, so frail and weak, You can barely even speak. Collapsing, fainting, crying, The truth is that you're dying. You scream and beg for treatments, But refusal is quite frequent. Your weight just keeps on dropping, You show no signs of stopping. It's not your fault you're ill, You're cure might be a pill. Or hard work and support, A hospital admission, not short. Three months you were there, Tube fed, but lots of love and care. Some beautiful and inspiring nurses, To help remove those curses. The ones that trapped you for years, Unravelling all of your fears. You're healing, you are healing, You finally have some feeling. It's possible to recover, A new you, you'll discover. I promise you'll be okay, Anorexia won't get her way.
Do you remember me? Hello lovelies. I'm back after another cheeky fling with recovery. I thought everything was fine and I was getting better, but then I weighed myself after 2 months of 'recovery' and saw a number I've never seen before and never want to see again: 175lbs. 175 fucking pounds of fucking fat. I literally felt sick when I saw what a mess I'd become, so I decided to spend the whole night flirting with my old friend razor blade. It felt so good to punish myself for my gluttony, but I realised I can't carry on dealing with failures like this. I need to deal with them by doing something about them. So here I am again, asking for your forgiveness, apologising for my disappearance, hoping you'll welcome me back into this circle. I've missed you all so much - I'm back now for good, I promise. I've decided to call this not a new start, but a new ending. I've had too many new starts and they've all ended in failure. This is my new ending, the beautiful ending I'm creating for myself. A beautiful, thin ending. Now I'm fully settled back into uni life after my placement (placement = place of evil wherein I gained 10lbs) I figure, what better way to step towards my new, beautiful ending than with the ABC diet. Week	Mon	Tues	Wed	Thurs	Fri	Sat	Sun Week 1	500	500	300	400	100	200	300 Week 2	400	500	Fast	150	200	400	350 Week 3	250	200	Fast	200	100	Fast	300 Week 4	250	200	150	100	50	100	200 Week 5	200	300	800	Fast	250	350	450 Week 6	Fast	500	450	400	350	300	250 Week 7	200	200	250	200	300	200	150 Week 8	Fast	ABC ends. I'm starting tomorrow with 500 cals. Does anyone want to join me? I've never done it before but I'm really excited to get back on track. I missed you all so much, did I mention that? Hope you've all been okay and you'll have me back :) I'll post again in a few days pinkie promise :) Rydw i'n caru ti, Kiki xx
Water Fast for Life Hello Guys I'm starting a Water Fast 1 November and I'm looking for a Fasting Buddy. Just someone to motivate you when times are tough. I really can do with someone to just remind me, what I am aiming for, when I need to hear it. Its true you cant tell someone you are Fasting.. cos it doesn't work. All I get is "you don't need to diet", "why do you want to kill yourself", "your metabolism will slow down", "Only fast for 3 days" etc etc etc, the list can go on and on. So support and understand amongst my Friends is not available - so on line I go. I don't have a time frame like 30 days or so... But my guess is, it would be longer than 30 days!  Even if you are not planning on Fasting that long... it would just be nice to know that you there. Reasons for Fasting... weight loss is a very big reason, but even so - its comes 2nd. My first reason is Colon bases... mine is screwed, along with my stomach lining and digestive and elimination track. Food does actually kill me. I'm hoping the Fast can cure that.  So here goes nothing! Love ya all! x
What I Ate Yesterday Breakfast: Mio Energy (Mio Energy Water Enhancer + Water) Lunch: One cube of Tofu, fifteen soy beans, some celery Dinner: Pancakes (1 cup of oats, 1 banana, 3 tbs water), Chinese Food (A small amount and only one plate full. I have small plates at my house, so that‚Äôs not as much as it sounds like. And my dad practically forced me to eat it. If it had been up tome, I wouldn‚Äôt have.) Stay Skinny Sweethearts üôÇ ‚ù§ ~Robin
aand its gone.. i can't fucking eat anymore. i'm too fucking fat. at least.. thats what she tells me... wow, i'm tracking myself. this is a good sign. here we go. Me: it'll be okay if i eat some chocolate and some of these fatty cracker things. im way below the normal amount of food anyway, i couldnt have gone above 1000 calories today. Her: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?????? Me: i'm enjoying this chocolate. it's yum. you didnt let me enjoy chocolate at christmas time. Her: because your FAT, and nothings changed! you've already gone over the limit today!! Me: it's okay, everyone has off days. Her: you can't afford to have off days, you FUCKING idiot, your birthday is in two weeks! Me: i've lost a kilo already! Her: one measly kilo, you're not even at your starting weight in year 9 yet. you're fucking fat. on your 18th everyones going to think your a fat cow compared to your 16th. and you wont want to look at the photos, just like after valedictory. you fucking whale. Me: ...*stumped*..... Her: good. you're not losing this fast enough, you've got to be at LEAST 52 kilos by your birthday weekend. no more eating. Me: you're right, it's the only way. breakfast though, it'll keep my metabolism up. Her: *sigh* you're right i guess. ONE weetbix. your limit is now 100 calories a day. Me: i can take this. i will be skinny. Her: yes you can! let's do this, let's get you gorgeous. ... Me: what will I do about tonight? Her: just stay up until you get hungry, then you can go to bed. that's the best we can do right now. Me: ok. starting tomorrow, i'll be strong. ... i can't stop listening.
No one knows the full story. Hello lovelies. I'm having a bit of an...I don't want to say epiphany but that's all I can describe it as. I've been thinking a lot lately about why and how I fell into this world, the world of ED. There hasn't been a direct trigger that has thrown me face first into this state of mind. I've had potential triggers, if that makes sense. I've had a fair few moments of trauma in my life which, should they had been directly followed by an ED I would understand but...they haven't. I did start cutting as a direct result of something. That I understand. But this? Seemingly out of the blue? That I don't. I stopped cutting about 2 years ago. It was so hard. It was like voluntarily shutting out a friend who knows exactly what to say to make you feel better, who has all the right words, all the right emotions, all the right blades. I'm wondering if I've subconsciously switched coping mechanisms. I used to cut when things went wrong, even little things, even nothing sometimes. I just found it comforting, like snuggling up under a blanket where nothing could hurt me. Nothing could hurt me except me, and I did just that. Is it possible that after almost a year of mental stability that I've fallen back? Is it possible that, without any direct trigger, I need my security blanket again? I can't use the old security blanket though, people recognize that one from when I curled up under it before. If I dug it out of the attic they'd know exactly what I was doing. I needed a new blanket that no one would suspect, and I got one. A brand-spanking new security blanket under which no one knows what I am doing. They just see a blanket, it's like my own secret world. My new friend. Did you ever sit up in bed and pull the duvet over your head and read or write or just be? No one knew what you were doing under there except you. Little do they know we're not reading or writing anymore, we're striving for something much more evident, something much more beautiful. We're all just writing under our duvets, we're all huddled under our security blankets. Why were we chosen? Why do we have to cope in such destructive ways? Why can't we just call up our friends and cry while eating ice cream? Why do we hide our sadness? Why can't we just talk about it? To someone, anyone... My problem now is, I'm feeling colder. I think I might need another blanket. I'm telling you, you're the only one who understands, you know that? It's difficult being so happy go lucky all the time. It's hard, it's all so hard. I don't want to break. Don't let me get the old blanket down, please don't. I can't cope on my own. I can't. I'm sorry for all this.. Rydw i'n caru ti, Kiki xx
But to anyone who is truly pro anorexia, and not just on here because they are lonely in their ED'S, please read this. First off, let me say what I'm sure you have heard a million times but are to "determined" to actually accept; having anorexia will not make you happy. You will be just as unhappy as a bulimic or a binge eater or anyone else who has used food as a way to cope with the shit that has happened to them. Im not going to use flowery language to describe this, because eating disorders are ugly and horrible to endure. For the few girls on here saying "oh but I just want to lose weight SO BAD, I JUST WANT TO BE SKINNY" I'm sorry, but get the fuck over yourself. If you are not already too sick to fight, FUCKING FIGHT! Don't just lie down and let your 'disordered thoughts' send you to the slaughter house. I am pretty sure the vast majority of people on here are not anorexic, but do suffer from some sort of eating disorder, and there is this very palpable vibe that anorexia is the 'coveted disease'. It suck just as much as any DISEASE. It is horrible and scary and lonely AND YOU WILL NEVER BE HAPPY WITH YOURSELF. I FELT JUST AS BAD ABOUT MYSELF AT 5'9 100 LBS AS I DID AT 130. I just needed to say this, as someone who has now been struggling for just over a year with a diagnosed anorexia, IT IS HELL, HELL, HELL. DO NOT talk yourself into some sugary fantasy about beautiful bones and feeling delicate and beautiful. It will never ever ever ever happen. Not because you wont be a bag of  "lovely, beautiful, graceful, PERFECT", bones. You will be, but you wont see it. You will see the same selfish, ugly, loud, evil, girl staring back in the mirror no matter how many pounds you starve away, and even if you recognize you are thin, you will come to the should-be obvious conclusion that, surprise, it doesn't change ANYTHING. So if you think there is a chance you dont really have an ED and are just on here because you think it sounds like a good way to fit into those true religions and get some attention, pull your head out of the clouds and FIGHT. You are worth it, but after the meat grinder experience of battling an eating disorder, that will be harder to recognize. And if you think you wont want to fight, you're wrong. You will, when you feel your body start to crumble and decay, you will wish you could be the strong, healthy, beautiful person you decided to destroy. But by the time you actually want to fight for your life (because your great little eating disorder will fucking KILL YOU) you won't be able to see two feet in front of you, you won't be able to make the decision to recover, not easily, not with out unimaginable pain. You will waste years of your life for no reason. Please, if you can, turn back now. I am so sick of girls just rolling over and giving into negative thoughts and allowing them to metastasize into anorexia and bulimia and binge eating disorder and every-other manner of hell we practice upon ourselves. It is not worth it. I promise.
Stomach Issues Have you ever laid down on your back and traced your hip bones and ribs? I do it all the time. I just wish that when I stood up I was able to do the same thing. I want those prominent hip bones, that caved in stomach, that tight skin over my ribs, those raised collar bones. It‚Äôs not fair. I have them when I lay down, and I want them when I stand up. I‚Äôm 108.7, a new low, but I‚Äôm not really able to enjoy it because it‚Äôs just not low enough. I have decided to stop eating anything I have not prepared myself and since I am not at home for most of the day, this means only dinner. Which will be small and controlled. ~Robin ‚ù§
Tips: 1) It takes 12 hours before your body starts feeding on its own fat. So don‚Äôt eat before 7am and after 6pm ‚Ä¶ your giving yourself a 13 hour fast. 2) If your craving something, grab a glass of water and count to 50. If that doesn‚Äôt work, brush your teeth. 3) Feeling hungry‚Ä¶ chew some sugar free gum 4) Drink tea, it suppress your appetite (honestly, I couldn‚Äôt survive without it) 5) Plain celery is your best friend because you end up burning calories as you chew. 6) Use small plates, it tricks your body into thinking its going to get more. 7) Drink water. Especially before, during and after each meal, it makes your fuller without adding extra calories. 8) If you must go out somewhere, take only the bare minimum amount of money so you cant buy food. 9) Always leave something on your plate, it will stop you compulsively finishing of your meal. 10) When you have a strong craving, go as far away from the kitchen. Lock yourself in your room for an hour and the craving will be gone.
It's a Cycle Thank you so much haze, determined girl, The Secret Me, Anna and B. for your beautiful comments, it's so reassuring to know that I will always be welcomed back with open arms, that I have a place where I know that every part of me is accepted. I love you all. It's odd how this 'eating thing' starts and grows... To this day it's impossible to explain that jump from 'life not going well' to 'lose weight to no end, that'll fix it' but I'm sure you guys will understand. It's odd the way it tears away from you and then pulls you back in... at least that's what it has done to me. There are theories, sure -- I'm insecure, my life is unstable -- but people are still left standing asking 'why?' It's a fair question. Why? Why would a well-off, passably pretty, passably talented girl dream and dream of destroying herself in the way that I do? After all, I don't have 'problems'. I'm not disabled, or terminally ill, or physically bullied, or sexually abused, or starving to death in Africa. I'm 'starving' myself in Australia. I don't know... I enjoy the calorie counting... it calms me. I plan my days eating in the morning or even a day before but of course there are days when a spanner is chucked in the works. Today for example, I planned on eating around 500 calories and burning roughly the same amount but no, I get home and mum had bought me two rolls of sushi and a mini cake... so of course I eat that and my days intake has jumped up to 900... the gym is soon though so I'm alright for now... I can feel the fat hanging off my bones. I just feel oily and, well, fat. I can't wait to work it all off. I can't handle this feeling right now. I've stopped seeing my psychiatrist which I'm happy about. She was lovely but I couldn't continue seeing her when I knew I wasn't being 100% honest. I thought I was ready for recovery when I went... but I'm not. Which makes me happy... Things are all about to change... I graduate in a week and a half, followed by a month of exams and then high school is over for me forever. It's incredibly daunting even though I know I should be excited. I also have to go to the beach next week which I'm incredibly anxious about. I'm not ready. My body is not ready. No one wants to see this. I have a party this Friday that I'm looking forward to, I'm planning on keeping my calories low but my alcohol intake high and I'm going to dance dance dance (burn burn burn). Ha. That sounds a bit messed up. Oh, there's also a guy in my life at the moment. We're not officially going out but... who knows. I guess I'll elaborate more on that later. I'm sorry if my thoughts are ramshackled and all over the place. Again, I love you all to bits. xxxxxxxxx

Support buddy Hi! I'm just reentering this because I gained a lot of weight pretty quickly after "recovery" and I feel like I could do much better with someone to talk to and support eachother, I know none of my friends would understand. I'm 20 years old, 6 ft, and currently weigh 188lbs, my goal is 150, and my lowest was 140. I can download whatsapp or kik I would just like to have a buddy or even a group so we can help and support eachother. 
It's Just Another Obsession I have had a fitbit for all of two weeks and I am absolutely obsessed. I'm obsessed with logging my food and activities, and making sure that I hit those goals. Always. It's just another kind of obsession.  It's not destructive in any way however, as I am following pretty closely to maintain a 500 cal deficit per day to lose 1kg a week. I have been allowing myself to eat sometimes as much as 1700 calories a day, but then picking that up with more exercise. I must admit, I do feel good - even if it's taking fucking ages to get skinny. When I say ages, I mean fucking ages. I am hovering around high 67's. I need to take an accurate weight tomorrow, cuz I got a bit drunk on Friday which fucks with hydration levels etc. I'm hoping I'm not enormously fat.  Anyway, I do have faith in what I am doing... And most importantly, I am fucking looking after myself.  Still vegan.  FP
all or nothing first of all, can anybody tell me how i can get notified of comments? i always tend to have to go into my blog and check. i just want one of those things like on myspace where it's like "new comments!" ha, i'm lazy. i decided that this whole 'losing weight slowly and healthily' thing was just a load of BS. it was TOO slow, and i gave up and binged. it's all or nothing for me. starting next monday, i will be fasting and restricting for summer. shouldn't be hard at all, considering i won't have exams to worry about and i can be anywhere and do whatever i want :) can't wait til freedom. the only thing that sucks about the upcoming freedom is it has to be summer. i HATE summer. i despise it. Here's a list why: 1. It's too hot to exercise, let alone MOVE 2. I get all sweaty and look like a bloated tomato 3. I have to wear clothes that reveal my fat-ness. 4. I break down a lot because of my lack of decent-looking clothing options 5. Clothes shopping is depressing, especially with... 6. BIKINIS!!!!!!!! 7. Can't eat soups :( 8. Having sex is exhausting and makes you all gross and sticky (and not for a good reason) 9. Sleeping in the same bed as my boyfriend is hard because he is a human furnace 10. People don't hug as much :( i love hugs :( 11. I hate icypoles, so when I'm hot i have to resort to icky Ice cream that melts everywhere and makes you stickier than summer sex 12. Makes me crave ice cream more. 13. CBF SUNSCREENING 14. ...and that leads to painful sunburn 15. You have to wear sunglasses and they slide off your nose and get annoying 17. My eye makeup (my trademark) sweats off 18. Having to deal with questions about why I like to wear tshirts and boardies over my bathers (fat stomach and scars on my legs) 19. The Beach! (bikinis + icky sand + salty water = PISSED OFF KATIE) 20. People always want to go out for fish and chips, which usually leads to B/P 21. Salads get boring after a while 22. Did I mention looking like a bloated tomato? 23. Can't do one of my favourite past-times, walking to Frankston, because of the heat 24. Too many BUGS! (i have a phobia of all insects) 25. Lack of sleep due to trying to kill all the aforementioned bugs 26. Being woken up by a buzzing mosquito just as I'm about to fall asleep! 27. Dresses. YUCK. 28. Have to show my fat arms. 29. BUGGGGGGGGGGSSSSSSSSSSS 30. Lack of motivation because of the stupid heat. 31. Winter coldness burns more calories. Enough said? Even so, here are some upsides that will benefit me this summer: 1. Too hot to heat fatty foods (aka chocolate, pasta, curries etc) 2. Excuse to just eat salads, it's too hot for anything else! 3. Cold water to boost metabolism 4. Yummy low-calorie fruit. 5. BOOST FRUIT SMOOOOTHIES when going out for lunch. once again, too hot for anything else. chyeah. and that's about it as far as the good bits of summer goes. so NOT looking forward to it. NOTE TO SELF: this is not the time to be writing blogs, go study for your exams tomorrow!
:)? Hello lovelies. So today went well I think. I ate: 4 rice cakes = 120 shapers chocolate = 81 vegetable stir fry = 400? 2 x coffee = 10 3 x tea = 30 hot chocolate = 40 = 681. I'm sure that's wrong somehow because I don't feel hungry. Argggg I'm always so scared I've messed up counting my calories. Even though I've been doing this so damn long I know how to add for gods sake. Wep :( So the food side of things seems to be going okay? I've been well under 1000 the past 2 days. My goal is to get down to eating 500 a day. By next monday I will, definitely. Eat less and less each day. Get smaller and smaller and smaller. and disappear forever. Goodnight everyone. Rydw i'n caru ti, Kiki xx
Motivation???... Someone.... Somewhere???? Ok nothing is working, im in desperate need of motivation... So bad it's not even funny! My life sucks right now, B got the sack last week so we're stuck on a single income (mine) my eating sucks, my exercise is lost and I'm not sure I'll find it anytime soon... I feel fat and pathetic!  Blah! I never post cause I'm so hopeless there isn't anything worth saying, if I do it will just be a rant like this post and I'm sure nobody wants to read that....  I need a plan, a diet, a fitness program, a lifestyle change... Something!!!!
Fml Need to get some ideas for a diet, that actually works unlike the soup diet I just did, been so good yet nothing happened I'm still the same fat weight as I was two weeks ago!  Starting to think I Should just eat fruit and veg an have a salad every night for dinner an a proper meal at lunch time like a sandwich or something!!! Blahhhh
I'm sick; As the heading states, I'm sick. On and off fever, terrible headache and just feeling bleeeerh. I hate missing school, as lame as that sounds. I've also been eating SO MUCH FOOD! Seriously, I don't think I've ever eaten so much. The thing is though, my bodies craving food so that it can get better, and I've been letting myself eat all kinds of things in hope that I'll get better really soon. The good thing is, I don't think I've put on that much weight since being sick because I was already fat to begin with thanks to the holidays. My body's been craving crazy things, like yesterday I had low fat ice cream with a crumbled weight watcher brownie. I dont even like either of those things. Oh well... I guess once I'm over whatever this is I can finally concentrate on getting THINNER. Oh! Guess what! Ok... during the holidays I accidentally drunkenly told two of my guy friends about my eating disorder... and since then they told my school counsellor who then rang my parents and told them. Then when they asked me about it I was like "phhhhh, no way man". And they were fine with that. Am I really that fat now that it's 'not possible' for me to have an eating disorder? If I was at my lowest weight right now they'd be all "PUT ON WEIGHT GIRL AND GET HELP". Anyway, sorry this blog is a bit... weird and out of character haha. That's just what happens when I'm sick. I'm finding it a bit hard to catch up on all your blogs and I'm really sorry about that. Once I get my own laptop (which shouldn't be too far away) it'll be so much easier :) Thank you all so so much for your comments, I appreciate it so so so so much. When I read your comments I get the biggest smile on my face. I look quite ridiculous haha. Girls, I hope that you guys feel like you can ask me all kinds of questions whenever you want. I love answering them and helping people if I can. Bonnie Blue O', to answer your question, I haven't had my period since early October/late September last year. You haven't had yours for two years?!? Wow... i know I'm not one to talk, but that's not good. I really think you should go see a doctor about it. Not having a period for so long can have bad affects sometimes. A doctor can fix it, I advise that you go see your doctor ASAP my love. I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH! xxx
I got the 1am blues. Hello lovelies. It's 1am and I'm wide awake. I've been thinking about how I never bring up my own problems or fears with my friends or boyfriend, and if I do I follow it with a nervous laugh. I've told my boyfriend I'm terrified about failing this year, just in the jokey format of 'If I manage to pass this year I'll shake my own hand! hahaha'....You know, that thing we do when we want to express something serious but don't really want to discuss it but we do but we don't but we do but we don't but we aarrrghhhhhhh! I want to call my boyfriend and cry and tell him I'm not okay. I want to scream that I'm terrified that I'm going to fail my exams and that I'm falling right back into the pits of depression again. How can I tell him this when he still doesn't really know me? He doesn't know I've been cutting for 11 years - hell - he doesn't know I've ever cut. He doesn't know I have depression, how do you tell someone that? 'Hey, how're you? Good *kiss kiss* yeah well I'm not so good I thought I had control over my depression that I've been suffering with since I was 8 but after about 9 months of feeling fine it's all come crashing down around me and I just want to scream and cut and cry myself to sleep but I can't let anyone know what I'm going through but I want to tell you so badly. Oh and by the way I've had an eating disorder for 2 years but only now do I think it's 'peaking' if you will. Only now do I feel like I might actually get fucking skinny for once and I want you to worry and hold me...is that wrong? I don't know, I just feel fucking miserable. So yeah...that's how I feel today, do you want to go watch a film or something?' We've only been together a month and a half so I really can't unleash my crazy on him yet. He's made me more determined than ever to get thin though, for the simple reason that he's drop dead gorgeous. I see girls glare at me when we walk through town, my friends are jealous that I've got him and I'm determined to keep him! He's so lovely as well, just the perfect man really. He's tall, dark and handsome. He's got the perfect frame in my opinion, he's not skinny (hate that on guys) but he's flat, you know? Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, he's gorgeous and perfect and I'm a fat heffalump. I'm not seeing him until the end of the week and I'm determined to get my stomach a bit slimmer by then. I want to be sliding size 10 jeans over my toned ass at the end of may. Hear that fat?! You're being EVICTED! Get the hell off my bones! Sorry for the randomness of this post and the last one, it's been a weird time. My mood has been flying around between extremes. Extreme stress, extreme motivation, extreme happiness, extreme depression, extremely overwhelmed, calm, extreme stress....you get the idea. Anyway, it's 1:06am now and I'm going to try and sleep but I have so much coffee in my system I doubt that'll happeeennnnn. Good night skinny lovelies :) Rydw i'n caru ti, Kiki xxx
HI~ I'M NEW   Just a little about myself~ My name is Kat , I'm 19, and I'm Anorexic I think i've had it for abouuuuttt 5 years now? I never really classified it as Anorexia until recently when my doctor confronted me about it. I used to be really skinny in middle school, under weight, but when i got into Highschool and got into an accident i started Homeschooling and gained all the weight. The biggest I've been was 144 And i am now 124 My goal weight is 100-105 maybe 95 I'm really looking for friends who know what I'm going through cause none of my friends understand me It'd be nice to seem normal ya know~
FATFATFATFAT   Hey everyone, you can call me Charlotte. I've gained a ridiculous amount of weight recently and I'm trying to lose it all again, so I would really appreciate any support/tips/people to talk to! I'm 5'8" and my lowest weight was 104 pounds, but my weight is currently fluctuating between 118 and 122 pounds, and I feel huge. My current goal is to get back down to 104 pounds. I might want to lose more weight after that, but I'm not sure what my ultimate goal weight is yet. I've just started fasting, so hopefully that helps me reach my goal. Good luck everybody! I'd love somebody to talk to.
I always felt better when I didn't eat. I guess I believed that maybe one day I would be able to look acceptable and soon it became a way of life. I saw that I was losing weight, but that wasnt enough. I wanted to lose more.  Remember to have Your Say. For a very long time I believed that it was my own thoughts and it took a lot of time - about a year - to be able to accept that they werent my own thoughts but something else.  It had convinced me that if I lost enough weight and became thin then I would also become acceptable and successful. I believed this lie for a long time.  This went on for a long time and my doctor told my parents to just let me do whatever and that I would eat when I was hungry.  I kept to myself that I was putting up with the constant bullying that no one else could see. They didn't understand and there was no way that I could tell them about my reasoning.  Looking back, that was a stupid thing to do.  I don't like seeing my reflection in mirrors as I hate everything I see. Wherever I am I always analyse the people around me to figure out who looks better than me.  Even though I'm getting better, my eating disorder doesn't stop telling me how disgusting I am, how fat I am and how I'm so worthless.  Eating disorders are not just about the food. There is so much more. They distort reality and you begin to believe these lies and nothing else. You live a life full of anxiety and fear. It's a scary way to live your life, it really is.  I've made it this far and one day, maybe I'll be able to say that I've beaten this eating disorder that has taken so much. It's not an easy thing to do
