Diet!! I've just been reading a fellow bloggers writing on how she's losing weight. I'm thinking this is something I must do too. Now that I have 3 grandchildren I need to be fit to play with them and at the moment I'm just so full of aches and pains. My one shoulder and arm hurts such a lot, I'm waiting to go for physio which may take up to 10 weeks for the appointment so I'm thinking a bit of exercise may work, nothing too strenuous mind you maybe start with doing more walking. I most definitely need to diet - or is that the wrong word - maybe I just need to eat more healthy, if I do that then surely the weight will come off too. So that's my new days resolution, more salads and veg and not as much biscuits and sweets. I'll let you know how I get on.
Where did I go? And pondering a lifestyle change... I reached 66 pounds of weight loss a few weeks ago...and promptly fell off the wagon. We have had some stress, and I am finding myself falling into my old emotional eating ways. I have even skipped two weeks of Weight Watchers meetings, which is a recipe for trouble. However, I have written next week's meeting into my calendar, and I have started using the Weight Watchers eTools as a way to give myself further accountability. I know I can get back on track, but to be honest, for a brief amount of time, I didn't really want to. I was taking a LOT of "comfort" (as brief as it was) from food. Now, I have the desire to get back on track, so I will start working toward that.  Sort of related is a change I am thinking of making with my lifestyle. I have spoken before about my desire to buy only humanely-raised animal products for my diet. Well, I am seriously considering going a step further with that and becoming what can be referred to as a pesco-ova-lacto vegetarian or more simply, a pescetarian. This would mean I would eat dairy, eggs, and fish, but I would no longer eat beef, pork, or poultry. I would still have to cook these things, as there is NO WAY my husband would make this change with me, but I would at least like to try this out and see how it goes. I am currently in the information-gathering stage, so I will keep you posted! 
Traumatized Flashback to 5th grade. I joined this drama program and everyday after school my friend and I would go to the MPR and we would have so much fun! It was basically like improv. but... with limits LOL And I remember the creator of the club would tell my mom that I was a really funny girl and that I should join drama in the future. And I have to admit that boosted up my confidence a SHIT load. I mean.. I even got the most candy! Okay so fast forward I'm in 6th grade and surprise surprise I took drama. That was one of my favorite classes to be honest cause I could be... myself! I wasn't shy or nervous because I always thought to myself.. What have I got to lose? So near the end of the year my teacher pulled me aside and was like "Allison you should really consider joining our drama club next year I would love to have you" (and this was the real shit like auditioning and everything!) and I was like aight aight I think I'm good enough so I applied and everything and guess what. Guess fuckin what.... I didn't make it. I think that was one of the most disappointing things that ever happened to me as a youngin. It was like someone climbed up a hill with you just so they could push you down when you reached to the top. I'd be lying if I said that it didn't scar me- cause it damn well did! I was too afraid to join any other activities with the fear of rejection/humiliation. Idk I just thought I would share this story cause I was thinking about it while I was showering.. I mean what if I did get in? What if I also joined it in high school... I'd be a completely different person with different friends and different... everything! So I mean in the end I don't regret anything.. Everything happens for a reason right? But.... fuck you Mr Stokes
Farewell to 2014, Hello 2015 2014 has been a hard year, with a week-long hospital stay early on and then weeks of serious illness in June, difficulties with the boys (teens and menopause are an insane mix), and continued financial difficulties. Good points have been the prospect of improving interpersonal difficulties through outside help we started accessing a couple of months ago, quilting retreats (always a good way to re-energise) and, as a result of my illnesses, discovering who our 'friends in action' are - those who stepped up and put their good wishes into actions when we needed help.  Made new friends, and discovered old ones. The boys enjoyed St John's Cadets (David, now 16, and his Division winning the State Drill Team award), Scouts (James, now 15, will be moving up to Venturers beginning this year) and archery, and Blake (now 11) enjoyed soccer, inline skating, wave-boarding, scooters, parkour and fishing.  John became active with the CFS, working on their Incident Command Vehicle, and he's done a great job (finally) in getting our small yard planted into a producing vegetable patch. http://sapa.asn.au/ 2015 is off to a rocky start, but plans are to fight against fatigue and pain and get the boys to as many Catholic events as possible (unfortunately most are down town so it will be an ongoing strain on health and finances).  The idea is to connect the boys with people their own ages who are fired up about their faith so that the boys don't see it as boring or irrelevant. David will be going away for 10 days in January for a Summer School of Evangelisation in Melbourne - his first big trip away!  Will have to offload some excess jewellery to find the money but I know it will be well worth it. http://www.summerschool.org.au/index.php I'll be off on a 3 1/2 day quilting retreat around the same time - it's a 'charity quilts' retreat at which we'll only be working on quilts that will be donating to charitable causes, e.g. heart kids, fire/flood victims, etc.  Sooooo looking forward to it.  I'm also planning to make a serious dent in my PhDs during the holidays and through the year. http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KOv7CbHYs18/UIl8RuxercI/AAAAAAAAB2w/XrdV8Oyzhxc/s400/202169470742578342_pag7INtl_c.jpg I've lots of ideas to do with the family this year - scheduled 'friends for dinner' days so the boys get to have friends over and include them in our family dinners, more structured outdoor activities like archery, cooking demonstrations & classes, parkour, fishing and beach days, etc (booked into my diary so they actually happen!). Also plan to get more involved in community activities - might even take up the ukulele!
The reason was??? So very annoying but my husband has lost the weight he wanted to lose, close on 2 stone.. although I 've asked him not to lose more as he has started to look scraggy!! And also to look like his Dad which he doesn't like to know, we eat the same meals, but I do eat less, so perhaps I'm not eating enough? So he has lost weight, while for months I have stood still.  Well not actually still, I have lost weight and then put some back on, eg lost 2 lbs, then maintained the next week, then gained one, then gained 1.5lbs, so back to more than when I started! It is so frustrating, no not just frustrating, but upsetting.  I asked for a blood test (not something I like to have) to check my thyroid levels and it was at the correct level! Damn I wanted it to need adjusting so that it was the reason for my lack of weight loss. I don't sleep well and it is suggested that good sleep helps weight loss, so that could be the reason? It's a vicious circle.. I sleep badly so I am tired when it's morning. Because we had to go out earlier this morning DH had to wake me and I don't know how I staggered around when we were out.   I don't feel like exercise on good days, well truth be told I hate exercise any day. Even walking is not my choice of activity. If I did perhaps I 'd burn off more calories and lose weight.. but Slimming World has always said exercise alone will not give weight loss.  But this week I lost 2.5lbs !!!! Wow how did I do that? So.. Not eating enough?.... NO So.. thyroid levels?...…......NO So ..sleep.............................NO So... Exercise......................NO So...what was it?? Ice-cream is 10g=1syn NOT ....20G=1syn!! And that's what has been my sticking point.. over eating my 15syns, it was DH who made the mistake, so as a punishment I have said he has to do my walking for me, ha ha.. So now I expect to be a lot less by Christmas, only 16 weeks to go.. yeh I could be 2 stones less?? I should be so lucky. Are you still on that diet or food plan, or have you like DH achieved your target? So... less ice-cream? Definitely if I want to lose weight! XX
VIVID SYDNEY 2016 Ah, Vivid Sydney. The yearly light festival where the crowds continue growing and I seem to find myself saying "I think last year's was better". This year, half of it was true- the event has reached insane proportions with throngs of people, dedicated transport and road diversions, information booths every 50m, you name it. That aside, I thought the opera house sails and building projections were the best I've seen yet!  I've been a few times since it started (see my really old posts HERE and HERE) and this year I felt like the exhibits were SO far apart from each other. Since we were too lazy to walk/trek halfway across Sydney, we only saw a very small fraction of what was on offer. Customs House, the Opera House and Art Gallery projections are still my favourite though. And the rest I will just have to settle with looking at photos of. Circular Quay & Harbour Bridge Customs House The Art Gallery Opera House - Lighting the Sails  I guess you can tell where we spent the most time huh! Side note: want to hear a weird story from one of the first times R and I went to Vivid together, years ago? We dubbed it the: Jewfish Incident We were walking around the Quay and decided to stop at one of the restaurants (a relatively nice place too) for a very late dinner/ warm drinks. R ordered a jewfish dish and we sat drinking hot chocolate while waiting for this jewfish dish. Since it was really late, we were the only ones there in the restaurant. So there we are all alone waiting, and waiting...and waiting. Still no jewfish. I enquired several times how long it would take and the waiter assured me no time at all. Well we got impatient (and had to go home) and I finally asked one more time, when is this jewfish going to come out?! Half an hour, the waiter said. What?! We had waited for almost an hour already! So we paid for our drinks and snacks and bailed apologetically. The restaurant manager came out and said please wait just a little longer and I will give you this beautiful jewfish free of charge. And we said sorry, cost is no consequence, we really have to go. Well just as we were almost at the station, the manager appeared out of nowhere and chased us down. He then proceeded to shove R's shoulder (lightly, albeit) and cursed our lives for our rudeness, ominously saying something along the lines of "something bad will happen to you tonight, you just watch". We were a bit spooked and hurried home. R then tripped over a drain and almost face-planted so perhaps that was the prophecy fulfilled. Nothing bad ever happened, though either way we never got to try that jewfish.
USA Day 3. Flying over the Desert So today I woke up ridiculously early (again) jumped in a taxi and set off to the airport. Everything went surprisingly well! My suitcase was a pound under the weight limit (something I was worried about since I was wearing lighter clothes), and check in was all good. I had a middle seat for the second leg of my journey but changing seats on American flights seems like its a lot more hassle here so I didn't bother attempting to change it.  While waiting for my flight to board an older gentleman came up to me and asked if I minded to a verbal survey on the airport - which was strangely nice as since I've spent so much time in airports I feel like I know what makes a good one! Anyway turns out he has a great granddaughter called Rachel and used to work at the hotel I had stayed at!  The flight was bumpy! Apparently the hot air makes turbulence pretty bad, and it was definitely one of the more unpleasant flights, and I was incredibly glad I'd missed breakfast…  I wish I had had a window seat as leaving Vegas and arriving in Phoenix were incredible views! They're both massive sprawling cities situated in the heart of a desert. it's craziness.  Just walking from the aeroplane to the airport in Phoenix was hell - I've no idea how Caitlin (or anyone) manages, never mind chooses, to live in such a crazy hot place! Again the flight from Phoenix to San Francisco was pretty horrid. But all in all I was only flying for like 4 hours so I can deal with that. And then it was all smooth sailing to get to the hotel!  Although the taxi driver did make a few phone calls and attempted to write down a number on a pad of paper while driving… San Fran is so much cooler than Vegas or Phoenix - it's around 27c but compared to the crazy temperatures of the desert that is complete bliss! 
Dieting and Metabolism Master your Metabolism by Jonny Bowden, MA, CNS (see more from this expert)  Taken from: http://diet.ivillage.com/issues/imetab/0,,3bc5,00.html  Q I've been dieting constantly on and off for years since I was a teenager, and have lost and gained the same 50 pounds more times than I can count. This last time I gained back even more. Have I ruined my metabolism?   A The idea that people can "ruin" their metabolisms is a very disempowering notion. To put it simply, you can't. You may have some metabolic issues due to yo-yo dieting, and understanding how your personal metabolism works can only help you in your weight loss journey. Let me explain.   For the sake of example, let's say you lose 50 pounds just by dieting. Let's further assume that about half of the weight you lost is fat and half of it is muscle. (These percentages aren't exactly right, but they're good for the purpose of illustration.) You've now lost about 25 pounds of muscle and 25 pounds of fat. Now let's say that you go off the diet and regain that 50 pounds. This time, almost all of the regained weight is going to be fat, and virtually none of it is going to be muscle. So at the end of the day, you weigh the same as before, but your body composition is significantly different. You now have a significantly higher percentage of body fat.   Why does this matter? Simple. Most of your calories are "burned" by muscle tissue. Fat is basically metabolic "dead weight." When you lose a lot of muscle, you lose one of your biggest allies in the war against fat. This shift in body composition is one of the things people refer to when they talk about their metabolism being "ruined" by dieting. To bring your metabolic rate up, one of the best things you can do is regain some of that lost muscle by adding weight training to your routine.   The other thing that frequently happens with yo-yo dieting is that you train your fat storage enzymes to be more efficient. When you repeatedly starve yourself, those enzymes simply become better at their job, an evolutionary strategy meant to keep you alive during times of famine. But by exercising consistently, eating fewer calories than you burn, and by eating the right kind of calories, you can re-train the fat-releasing enzymes to come out of hiding.   And speaking of the right kind of calories ...   Most people in your situation have been trying to lose weight using a low-fat diet. Unfortunately, that's probably exactly what you should not be eating. Low-fat diets are typically high-carb diets, and high-carb diets virtually guarantee that your body will constantly produce high levels of insulin, also known as "the storage hormone." The body does not burn fat in the presence of high levels of insulin. The solution? A moderate-calorie diet that is higher in protein and good fats (such as olive oil) and lower in carbohydrates than your average low-fat diet.   The point is that there are specific positive actions you can take right now to work with almost any metabolic issue you may have as a result of your dieting history. Put these strategies into action right now, and maybe the next time you lose that 50 pounds will be the last time you have to do it.
My New house and Happy Hallween Hay Guys, well yesturday I was packing everything, Clothes, CD, DVD, My photo of my family mebership and other's stuff. I can't waite to moving to new house at Normanvill I was a bit nervous yesturday. My room a house a"Huge" My bedroom, Family room, Dinning room, lauch room, Kitched is so "HUGE" and other's you know why beacouse my real parent are really rich they gave it to me :) and my firend are rich well. Well I'm very happy about that. And I was wearing in halloween as a "Grim Reaper as death" :)~ hahaha Happy Halloween. And some of my others cousin wearing a "Witch" as well. Tell me about what you wearing in Halloween? I tell mine ok :). I hope you have a nice day :). From Marissa xoxox
When You See My Face Hope It Gives You Hell Haven't been posting any LOTD, so here's a few for you. Also Happy St. Georges Day! Despite my frequently assuring people that England is shit, I'm quite proud of where I come from and I missed the UK a lot when I lived in Canada. No crumpets. I think I'll do a very English LOTD today. So this is my look of... er, Monday. I've been feeling very uninspired at the moment and luckily Youtube is always there to help me out! JenniseMakeup's channel has this gorgeousOrange Smokey Eye Tutorial, so I had a little go at that. One stupid face right there! I have no idea why I did such heavy black liner on the bottom. It kind of ruined it and I didn't have time to fix it before I left. I don't remember what I used entirely, the brown liner is a Gosh liner, the orange is Barry M and the rest is probably Sleek. My dress was from good old New Look. I finally got the Sleek Bohemian palette and I love it! This look was all Bohemian shadows. The purple blended with the shimmery rusty colour is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I'm also really grateful for the pale skin-tone colour. I didn't have a matte neutral that was a decent match for my skin tone before and so I didn't realise how useful it was! This look was pretty dark and maybe a bit too OTT for work, but I've decided I really don't care anymore :) My hair stuck up like that ALL DAY yesterday. All damn day. Anyway, this one was inspired by xparkages Violet Vixen tutorial. I didn't use any blues as I wanted something more soft and springy and I didn't want the harsh cut crease. Ok, so I suck at cut crease looks. I need more practice. I used Nyx jumbo pencil in Milk and Nyx White Pearl eyeshadow and all the purples are from the 120 palette. I'm very much an aethiest, but THANKYOU, BABY JESUS, for the Nyx pencils. The payoff of a fair few of the 120 palette shadows is pretty poor, but the pencils take care of that. Which is amazing. Some of these colours are soooo pretty. Right. Thats my face, I'm going to do another post of some recent manis for you :) Love and Kisses, Robyn xxx
Some sugar, but mostly sense. I baked last night and this morning. There's a ridiculous amount of things I still need to post, and I don't know where to start! I haven't uploaded last night's pictures. Suffice to say: dark chocolate. And green tea. Mmm. On another note. Borders just released their 100 Favourite Books of All Time I had a really quick look at the top ten. 1. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen 2. To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee 3. Lord of the Rings, J. R. R. Tolkien 4. My Sister's Keeper, Jodi Picoult 5. Twilight Saga Collection, Stephanie Meyer 6. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone 7. The Time Traveller's Wife, Audrey Niffenegger 8. The Book Thief, Mark Zusak 9. Nineteen Eighty Four, George Orwell 10. Magician, Raymond E. Feist I'm not too happy with this list, to be completely honest. I get that the top three are classics, and I really liked 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. We studied it in English class, and I really enjoyed it. Harry Potter and The Book Thief are both excellent as well. But Twilight? It's 'favourite books of all time', not 'favourite ridiculous tween fantasy vampire fads'. I'm sorry if I annoy anyone with this rant, but TWILIGHT. COME ON PEOPLE. It's a pathetic love story, with a Mary Jane protagonist that is selfish, whiny and just plain annoying. FIFTH? Even undead blood-drinkers and lycans can't redeem the book. You want vampires? Go to Anne Rice, or Bram Stoker. Not Stephanie Meyer. Okay. I'm over it. -breathes- I'm just disappointed Neil Gaiman (American Gods was 71), Alice in Wonderland (came 32nd), Gregory Maguire, Terry Pratchet (Good Omens was 96th) or any other really good authors didn't make it up there. Stupid Twilight.
Day 10 weigh in day - another bead! Hi, I've been a bit remiss in my blogging but I have been very good in my eating and am proud to report a 1.1kg loss which brings my weight down to 117.9 and more importantly, I've earned another bead - yay! Things that have happened since I last blogged... I have been given the ok from my physio to do a bit more exercise but still no running. I've been to the gym a few times, twice yesterday and my back is a bit sore today.  My trainer and I set down some goals based around my upcoming travels. I will be going to India on October 15 and my target weight for this is 114kg. Then we're off to Dubai at Christmas and my target weight is 104 with the return weight of 102. So that means I'll have to be conscious of the amount of food I'm eating plus the I will need to exercise while I'm away - not a bad thing on the whole. In March, we're off to Germany for three weeks and my target weight is 92. It made me feel good to set goals, I need to be focused to reach them. I went to a hen's night on Saturday which started with afternoon tea. I was pretty good - drank soda water all night but did nibble a bit too much. The hen herself was incredibly entertaining, my favourite part of the night was when she had to get up on the couches at the cocktail lounge and dance for two minutes... she got more and more inventive as the dance went on and we left her up there for a full five minutes by which stage she was into the full leg kicks! Mmm maybe you had to be there but trust me it was pretty funny at the time. Sunday we had brunch at our friends and goddaughter's place. I had my strawberry bruschetta which was a hit and then we stayed on for a quick lunch which was also very healthy. Stu and I did the shopping in the evening but we were well set up for the week to come. Monday and Tuesday flew by in a haze of work but I am proud to say I have been following the food program and it's getting easier - I only had to have my tea with two sugars after lunch yesterday as the sweet cravings have been lessening.  So it comes to this morning, Wednesday morning, the sun is shining, I'm trying to make my breakfast smoothie - must either warm up the frozen berries before trying to pulverise them with a stab mixer or buy a blender - not working very well. I'll have a shower and then give it another shot. Enjoy your Wednesday, there will be photos of the new bead up tomorrow! Tiff xoxo
Since the 1st July series: overview Okay. So I reset myself on the 1st July and today is the 1st October.  It's been 3 months - or 13 weeks and 1 day.  It's about time I start sharing what I've been doing! As I said a couple of posts ago, I genuinely mean to blog, but I get so ridiculously overwhelmed, so easily, that I put it off.  Not just blogging, but everything.  I haven't opened my Facebook in 3-4 weeks.  The little red notifications number must be capped at 99,  A screenshot of my Facebook app #shakes because it was 99 more than a week ago, and it keep refreshing.  The more refreshing it does, the more I get overwhelmed, and the more anxious I get about opening up the app. So I don't. And it just gets worse (I get more behind). It sounds ridiculous, because it is. But that's how overwhelm rolls. And it's the same with blogging.  As I said on that post I just mentioned, I had a genius idea to write a list of topics to direct me to write a series of shorter posts.  Wonderful! That list is yet to be put together (I have 3 half lists).  That in itself makes me overwhelmed. SO. I'm just going to start writing and see where it takes me.  This is going to be an overview, and then step by step, just like all good journeys, I'll choose and write about one aspect of what I've changed / been doing.  And then write the one after that.  And then the one after that.  Like the quote I used on Instagram this morning: "You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain." (Tom Hiddleston) So, where I am at today? -16.7kg down, since resetting on 1st July.  This is my current monthly weight loss chart (I weighed in this morning to get September's result, so it is as up to date as you can get! While my weight has been going down (since 1st July, anyway!), everything else has been going up and down, like most humans.  (Life was never meant to be straight and stagnant, was it?) My food has been up: and down: My emotions have been up: and down: My habits have been down: and up (yes, I changed the order of this one on purpose because I've battled this one, go me!) (I did keep scrolling) You get the picture.  I've had some of the best days of my life and some of the worst.  And while I am an actress, I am not being dramatic.  It's been a whirlwind few months of ups and downs. But through it all, not only have I gotten through it; I've maintained myself on this health journey, and I'm pretty frigging proud of myself for that. Let me let you go for now, so I can get onto start writing the first post of the series of "Since the 1st July".🙂 This post only took me an hour to put together completely - I'm pretty impressed!  Let's see how I go with keeping my posts short and succinct.  Two words that I have never quite grappled so far in my early-mid age. Thank you for those who have been following me, some of who have done so for years.  It's those of you who see what I believe in my heart, that I will eventually break through all of the barriers that I am trying to break through. "Thank you", will never be enough. Love Kate xoxo P.S. Check out Michelle Bridges' new book, "Keeping It Off".  It got released this week and there's a very special page that you should check out: page 39.😉  It's a bit about me!  Congrats Mish on tackling such an important subject.  I don't need to explain the relevance of the book's topic to me.💗 Mish's new book Page 39🙂 P.P.S. I've still been updating my Snapchat and Instagram stories more than I have any other social media lately.  (They're identical, I record on Snap and then upload onto Insta as soon as (and if) I have time, so Snap is more in the moment and used more.)  But if those platforms interest you, then you can find me there in the (many times) I'm not blogging).🙂  My Snapcode is: And then, of course, my beloved Instagram.  I feel like I've been posting less since I started using Snap and Instagram stories, but it's still a constant for me:

You can always find me on Instagram at runtallmom.  Happy New Year!!
Exercise for happiness My two sons love watching TV and playing games on our phones. I know how easy it is to let hours slip by with them engaged in this way every day. According to a survey children aged six to eleven are thought to watch an average of 28 hours of television, video and computer games a week (four hours a day), with two to five year olds watching an average of 32 hours (Nielsons, 2009 How Teens Use Media - A Nielsen report on the myths and realities of teen media trends). Another survey found that four hours a day was a minimum for six to fourteen-year-olds, but that this often doubled during the weekends and school holidays (Rideout, V.J., Foehr, U.G. & Roberts, D.F. 2010 GENERATION M2 Media in the Lives of 8- to 18-Year-Olds). Parents clearly need encouragement, support and advice on getting their children up and off the couch - myself included. The long term effects of this level of sedentary behaviour are mammoth and include obesity, delayed speech, aggression, lack of physical and psychological development. Most worryingly is that starting out life like this sets up a really strong pattern for continuing life like this. I certainly don't want my children to struggle with any of the above problems as they grow up. I need to give my children the right example of physical activity and engage them actively every day. For under 5's this needs to be at least 3 hours of a day (not consecutive). We all need to take responsibility in this, parents, schools and government. Something else that I believe is overlooked in this dilemma is our children's general happiness and their ability to be happy throughout their life. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a hungarian professor, is the architect of the concept of 'flow' - a state of concentration or complete absorption with the activity at hand and the situation. It is a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter. (Csikszentmihalyi,1990). He developed this concept from his work in trying to understand human happiness and studying the creative processes of artists and the like. When in the flow we are also at our happiest. When in a state of apathy we are at our unhappiest but don't necessarily understand why. Activities that induce apathy are typically ones where we are not challenged nor require any skill - eg watching TV. The more time we spend doing them, the stronger the pathways of apathy we create in our psyche and the more we diminish our interest and ability to engage in activities requiring challenge and skill thereby denying ourselves the joy that comes from being in the flow. Lets be mindful of the effect of our choices today on our children's and our own future happiness! http://www.bhfactive.org.uk/userfiles/Documents/guidelineswalkers.pdf http://www.boysdevelopmentproject.org.uk/downloads/reports/BDP_A4Factsheet(refs)%20copy.pdf  http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow.html
It's a Good Day to be Fat! Today (Saturday) I feel I've had a fantastic day, food-wise. I have had essentially 4 dinners, plus loads of snacks! I had a portion of lasagne made with pro-cal powder - roughly 500/600 calories. 1 Domino's pizza (ham, pineapple, chicken and double cheese) - 700 calories. 3 Domino's cookies - 165 calories each. A bowl of scrambled egg covered in ketchup also made with pro-cal powder - roughly 300 calories. Supplements - 400 calories. Add onto that, a few bags of crisps, two cans of coke and a pack of maltesers :) &Now..... I'm starving again!!!! Yet I feel full, how can I feel so full but feel so hungry lol! I may just deal with having a hot chocolate or cup of tea or something, I don't think my stomach can hold anymore food, at least not right now, maybe in like 10 minutes or so ;) Me and Megace are getting along very well, it has made my periods pretty irregular as I was warned but the benefit of the appetite absolutely landslides the not-so-good side of things!! So I'm a very happy (chubbier) girl at the moment and I'm very pleased with myself. I hope that todays goodies will have a reflection on my weight on Monday when I attend Papworth for my day 7 check-up whilst on IV's, which seem to be helping might I add! I do have a headache still which is a very annoying pressure type headache where I do seem to find myself shutting my eyes quite a lot, but I'm hoping this is just the IV's and not the beginning of 'oxygen headaches' I used to wake up everyday with an awful headache which is when we then did tests to show my oxygen levels significantly dropped overnight, hence why I use my o2 when I sleep, this cleared the headaches up almost immediately, so I'm hoping it's just an IV headache and nothing else! Time will tell I guess, but for now, my chest feels better, breathing is slightly easier and my chesty cough is back to a more dry, tickly type cough. :) So I'd say this is a pretty positive blog to be honest! Wooohoo, finally pretty much all good stuff to report! xxx
Sweating Silliness Sometimes when I'm hitting the gym I feel like what I do there is so silly. I mean what practical skill does curling a dumbbell actually replicate? Perhaps lifting a very odd-shaped bag? I definitely get the "hamster on the wheel" syndrome when I get on the treadmill too. I know it all builds muscle and endurance. . . plus it burns calories, but if an alien culture were observing us . . . it would be interesting to know their take. The bottom line is I have taken in too many calories in my life and I need to burn them off, and when it is -40 below out, going for a scenic hike doesn't really sound appealing. So, I need to get over sweating the silliness.
Saturdays are FITNESS DAY Just when I needed him most... I'm struggling BIG TIME with motivation... I get a text from my personal training informing me we won't be meeting tomorrow or ever again due to hi transferring clubs closer to his home... right across the street to be exact... :o/    He gave me the name of the guy he was going to pawn me off too... but I don't know. I'm super picky about trainers and aside from my trainer there is only one other trainer I really would consider training with but according to my former trainer he has a busy schedule.  My new trainer Sal called me. He sounds super young, I have an idea of who he is... and I don't think I'm interested in training with him. Being that I've worked in the fitness industry before, have friend's who are trainers, and am a life long dieter/weight loser... I don't want a green trainer. I need someone who has been there and done that. Someone who can teach me more than one or two things. I need to get my money's worth! I'm meeting with him tomorrow and then have a chance to decide whether I want to continue personal training or move on to something else.  I had an AWESOME trainer, but he wasn't too motivational. I think I trained with him so long because he was more of a therapist for me... once a week get together, workout and spill my guts about everything.  A friend of mine who is a personal trainer a few months back gave me her certification manual. I told her about the switch, she told me I pretty much know what I need to do to get to goal... when I'm ready to fine tune she'll help me. Cancel my personal training, use that money on other things and read the manual she gave me.  Suddenly, thinking about what I can do with an extra $100 a month got me motivated to lose weight again! I could buy Roller Skates to exercise... I can do 5K workshops, I can buy better workout shoes... I can afford to buy myself weight loss incentives... and I can try Weight Watcher meetings again if I'd like.  My options are limitless with that extra $100 a month. I'm so excited and motivated now I don't really feel like meeting with Sal tomorrow... I feel like going in and right away cancel my service and get my money back for the 4 sessions I have left.  But I set my appointment... so I'll follow through... but Monday I'm calling guest services and finding out how I can cancel my service and get my money refunded.  Saturdays I'm declaring Fitness Day! It's the day I officially weigh in, regroup, set my new goals... and update here.  I'm on this journey all alone... but for some reason I feel motivated! I'm excited! Being FIT here I come!
Peanut Butter Cup Blondies There was a beautiful breeze blowing through my kitchen window on Sunday morning. Everyone in my family was taking a nape, leaving the house was quiet, with the exception of the birds chirping outside, the trees blowing in the wind, and the sound of the an occasional card driving by on this dead end road. It felt so much like autumn I think I should've been baking apple pie instead of blondies! These blondies are very moist, dense, soft but still chewy, with the wonderful taste of peanut butter and chocolate. I've used this blondie recipe before, and I stole the chocolate frosting recipe from my awesome friend "hollie". The difference? This time instead of nuts and chocolate chunks, put chopped Reeses peanut butter cups in the batter. No, it's not original at all, but it's extremely tastey! blondie1.jpg I used a 12 oz. package of reeses minature peanut butter cups and chopped them however I liked. Usually fours, thirds and in half. blondie3.jpg Blondies (recipe found here, on SmittenKitchen) one 12 oz. package of Reeses miniature peanut butter cups. 16 tablespoons butter (2 sticks) , melted 2 cup brown sugar (I used dark) 2 egg 2 teaspoon vanilla 2 Pinch salt 2 cup all-purpose flour Unwrap Peanut Butter cups and chop into pieces of either fours, thirds, or halfs. Butter an 9x13 pan Mix melted butter with brown sugar - beat until smooth. Beat in egg and then vanilla. Add salt, stir in flour. Stir in chopped Reeses. Pour and spread into pan. Bake at 350°F 20-25 minutes, or until set in the middle. (mine cooked a little longer than this) While baking, prepare frosting. Chocolate frosting: 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 6 tbls. boiling water 1 stick butter 3 cups powder sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract add the cocoa powder and water in a medium bowl and stir into a soft mass. Add butter and blend to combine, about 30 seconds. Beat in powder sugar and vanilla on low speed until incorperated. Beat on medium speed until forsting lightens and is fluffy, about 2 minutes. Let Blondies cool the spread with forsting. WARNING: these won't last long!

Four Things I Have Learnt in My Teenage Years Summer 2014 - Leeds Festival Summer 2011 - My 16th Birthday As I am now in my last year of adolescence (yup, the big 2-0 next birthday!), I thought it may be prudent to share some snippets of knowledge gained from my 'youth'. 1)     Some people aren't worth fighting for, or worth your tears. That girl who you though was your best friend? If she could upset you that much without any remorse, is she really the kind of person you want to be friends with? And did you need him to prove your self worth? Were the uncomfortable conversations worth you trying to stick up for yourself necessary? If he cared, he wouldn't have made you cry. 2)     Most people don't care that you're not perfect - it's really only you. You know what? He did love you at one point. He called you beautiful when you were having a Fat Day. He bought you chocolates because he cared about making you smile, not about the extra pounds you would put on your waistline. You have beautiful best friends who love you no matter what. If they've managed to put up with you for 8+ years, you know you aren't doing too badly. 3)     It is possible to find the strength and maturity to pull through the tough times. When the boy you thought you loved screwed you around you sat in your friend's bedroom at a house party consoling yourself with a two-litre plastic bottle of piss-water Strongbow. And then you moved on. It's okay to cry when your feelings are hurt. And three, four years later you're becoming friends again. When the boy you did love dumped you, you sat on your bed alone and cried down the phone to your best friend who, as always, came to the rescue. And then you got angry. It's okay to be angry and heartbroken, it is. And look at you now a year later; you made it. 4)     Don't set your expectations too high. If you do, disappointment is likely. If you reach for the stars and fall foul at the moon you'll resent yourself. You will. Instead, just try. Try your absolute hardest and you'll surprise yourself. You will.
background So, as I said before, I am moving to Australia in three days. I have two little sisters. We are not going directly to Australia. First we are going to Washington D.C., to visit some family members for a week. We are stopping a night in Denver before we go to our next destination: Hawaii, which is about ten hours of flying on a plane. We are going to stay there for five days, and then later finally arrive in Australia, right on time for Christmas and summer vacation.

Short check in and a weigh-in after a holiday  My chosen weigh-in day is Sunday for two reasons: 1) it's the start of a new week and 2) to dissuade me from having a food fest blowout all weekend.  Because the 4th of July is on a Saturday this year, I thought about weighing in Saturday morning rather than Sunday.  It wasn't because I wanted to eat tons and tons, but I knew that we would be having baked potato salad and burgers.  I was worried the food and increased sodium would cause me a gain.  I'm not going to lie, it took me a while to make the decision.  I really wanted to have a nice time on the 4th without worrying about food.  In the end, I decided not to step on the scale Saturday.  I felt like I would be cheating myself if I weighed in early so I didn't.  Still, I thought about weighing  to see what the number was so I would know just how careful I should be, but I didn't do that either.  Instead, I went on with my day, enjoyed myself , tried to be careful, but still exceeded my daily calorie limit by over 500 calories (brownies are my weakness).  It wasn't a blowout and the scale reported a three pound loss for the week.  I was surprised to have a nice loss for two weeks in a row, but I won't be complaining anytime soon either.  This morning I weighed 380 and am now looking forward to being in the 370's soon.  This has been a relaxing three day weekend and I enjoyed myself immensely.  I'm feeling tired and will close for now.  How was your weekend?  Did you overeat or stay the course?  Thanks for stopping by, Tammy
Breaking the drought Hellooooo! For the 70th time since starting this blog, here I go again with a few (!) weeks in between saying hey.  For those who follow me on IG or Snap in particular, you would have watched me many times in the last month or so saying "I'll blog the details" or "I'll explain everything on my blog" or "I promise I'll blog this weekend." I do mean it!  But sometimes, like with weight loss, it just takes me a little longer than most to actually get it done. I truly have so many stories and things to share; all things weight loss (and gain!), exercise, injuries, food, life ups and downs, lessons, overhauls, creating a better version of myself and of course my usual "only Kate" stories, that I just don't know where to begin.  But I'm doing myself up a little 'bite-sized chunks' plan, where everything seems a little bit more achievable; so that I can share everything, where it won't take me 7 hours to write each post, and where you won't need to call each blog post a novel. This post is just the quickest of quick summaries, (really - I've given myself 25 minutes!), simply to break the writing drought, to say hi and to give you the briefest overview of where I'm at. My previous post was saying how nervous I was about my high school reunion at the start of June (far out, Kate!)  Well, I survived that, just (that's on my list of topics).  I continued to eat like it was the last supper all through June and piled on even more weight.  I'll add my 2017 monthly weight calendar onto this post so you can see at a glance how my year has been in that department. Anyway, somehow I pulled myself together on the 1st July and have been going well with the food thing since then.  I've lost 11kg so far and other than the last few days of a slight  My 2017 according to the scales chocolate overload, I'm still on track.  I've been trying a few new things and they're working. In a nutshell, I have never enjoyed my food so much, felt such a low (no) need to binge, and have never felt such 'food freedom' as I have in this past month.  I can't wait to share all of my little stories, updates, recaps and explanations, now that I'm doing a plan and have officially broken the writing drought! Be back soon, my 25 minutes is up! Love Kate xxoo
Set Free Those who are Hurting  The devil only comes to kill, steal, and destroy... John 10:29  This world has really become something. When you truly realize the awful truth of things going on daily, it hits you hard.   Human trafficking is something that has recently become huge. When I realized that there are humans everywhere around my age, younger, older, who are being used and abused, I wanted to do something to bring it to awareness.   Houston, Texas is the largest human trafficking city in the USA. Today, the 51st Superbowl was held in this city. Take away even the fact that Houston is the largest human trafficking city, the Superbowl attracted all kinds of people who are looking for this kind of activity.   Tonight during halftime, we refrained from watching the sick music, and prayed for our nation. One thing that my family discussed was the horrible truths of trafficking. We imagined multiple guys and girls being snatched up by the minute. But it wasn't our imaginations because this is a reality these days.   Evil is prevelent. We have to accept this, but we also have to do something about it. There are three big things you can do.   1. PRAY: This is the most important thing we could ever do. Pray that these young people are saved physically and spiritually. And that they would be comforted in whatever situation they are in knowing that Christ is with them.   2. Be aware: Keep your eyes out and don't go places by yourself-- you could personally become a savior, or a victim.   3. Donate: There are many organizations out there trying to prevent this reality. Even the smallest donation can help save lives.   As we sit to watch football tonight, remember that there are young humans out there being enslaved into awful, terrible lifestyles. Our world is filled with evil because Satan is trying to gain control over this world.   Keep your eyes on Jesus and live ultimately for Him. We have it easy, just be aware and do all you can to make a difference.   Thanks and have a great week!  His Handmaiden, B.M. <3
First weigh-in of 2015  January 12th already?  It seems like it was just yesterday that I was relaxing over the holidays with my eighteen days away from the office.  While I enjoy and look forward to the long break at the end of year, I do not want this year to rush by.  I need to make my time count this year and make progress on the weight-loss front and towards better health.  Here are the stats from my weigh-in this weekend.  Starting weight:  399.8 lbs Current weight:  393 lbs + / - since last:   -7 lbs lost  This loss is a fair representation of the effort put towards it and I am happy.  I haven't spent a lot of time yet deep thinking about my plan or actions needed for the year.  I want to do this and need to this, I just haven't done so yet.  What I have been doing though is trying to make  more conscious decisions about what I eat and don't eat.  This means that I don't always follow through with the first impulse I have, which is a very smart thing since I think about food often.  Trying to slow down the process and not allow the quick fix which is usually not the healthier option is helping me to eat smaller portions and from home rather than take-out.  My eating hasn't been perfect.  I've had some high-carb meals and way more fat and sugar than I need, but all-in-all have consumed less than if I wasn't trying.  One of my goals for 2015 is to be more active/less sedentary than past years.  In an effort towards this goal, I have been pushing myself to get up and do stuff.  I'm talking small things, a quick chore here and there.  Last year, I was the laziest I've ever been.  My body and house show for it.  I may not be able to exercise for 30 minutes yet, but I can do things in short bursts and every little movement is more than I did before.  The more time on my feet means the less time on my butt.   It's a start and I hope it continues.  Other than the small steps I've been trying to make with the food choices and movement, life is back to normal after the break.  Work, more work, and trying to avoid all the sickness at the office.  It seems a lot of people are coughing and sneezing, including my husband.  He's on the tail end of his cold, and knock on wood I believe I dodged it this time.   The sun is shining and the Seahawks are still in the race, so life here is looking good.  Hope you're doing well too.   Enjoy, Tammy (for Biz)
News Just In! Aloha Bloggerinos, I have just come back from the salon with blondey blonde blonde hair! Oh yes! It's my hen night tomorrow night *prays the girls haven't booked a stripper* so I thought I would give myself a bit of hair love. My hair is an absolute beast and is so thick that the hairdresser looked a little like she wanted to stab me with her comb after a couple of hours, mwahahaha. (my arty eye- see below for reason!) Now, I have a few bits of news so I thought I would moosh them all together like a News-Just-In-Hotpot. Firstly, I have recently heard that Cosmopolitan have launched the 'Cosmo Blog Award', sponsored by the ever brilliant Collection 2000. They are calling upon all blog readers to nominate their favourite blog and I am calling upon my lovely Bloggerinos to click HERE and give me a mention. I kid you not, I would piddle my pants with glee if you did that for me, I would be touched (ooerr) and honoured! piddlepiddle.  (Hair fascinator for ETSY shop- reason below) Secondly, I am starting up an ETSY shop! I have set it up but it needs tweaking and product pictures uploading. I wanted really pretty pictures and my chum Rob said he would do them for me. Rob has done weddings, portraits, arty pictures of the sea type things, 'real' shots of people, and now of course, my crafty bits. He will read this and be annoyed that I haven't described him very well at all, so Rob, I'm sorry!! Anyway, I will share a couple of pictures (scattered amongst this post) with you and of course point you to my ETSY shop when it is officially open, but if there is anyone in the Midland/Anglia type region and you would like a fantastic photographer, leave a comment and I will pass on his details. What he enjoys most (aprt from Photography bookings), is when you say his car looks like a panda. It's his fav. (cupcake Earrings for ETSY shop) Thirdly, thank you to everyone for their well wished for Mattmoo, who was in hospital this week. He is on the mend now and a happy chappy being so spoilt. I think that's all for now lovely jubbly Bloggerinos. I'm off to do a few crafty bits for my shop and then get packing for my Hen Night! Woooo!! If any of you are out in Liverpool on Saturday, keep your peepers peeled and say "Aloha" to me! Toodlepip! xx
Angel Food Cake I love watching The Great British Bake-Off and this week they made Angel Food Cake in the technical challenge and the end results looked delicious! I don't have a Mary or a Paul judging my baking skills, but I do have an eager husband and a willing group of family and friends who are all hungry for more of my baked goodies, so I thought I would give it a go. In week one we saw the 2013 contestants bake and decorate an Angel Food Cake  Mary's Angel Food Cake looked like the one above with a lemon and passion fruit curd which sounds divine! My husband isn't a huge fan of lemon flavours so I decided to go for something slightly different and topped it with fresh berries instead. What do you think? I was so impressed with myself and the final cake looked and tasted fantastic!! ...this weekend I will be attempting the next technical challenge and will be making breakfast muffins! wish me luck.
On Never Giving Up, Never Quitting When the Goal is In Sight! An Inspirational Poem "Don't Quit" by Edgar A. Guest  When things go wrong, as they sometimes will, when the road you're trudging seems all uphill, when the funds are low and the debts are high, and you want to smile but you have to sigh, when care is pressing you down a bit - rest if you must, but don't you quit. Life is queer with its twists and turns. As everyone of us sometimes learns. And many a fellow turns about when he might have won had he stuck it out. Don't give up though the pace seems slow - you may succeed with another blow. Often the goal is nearer than it seems to a faint and faltering man; often the struggler has given up when he might have captured the victor's cup; and he learned too late when the night came down, how close he was to the golden crown. Success is failure turned inside out - the silver tint of the clouds of doubt, and when you never can tell how close you are, it may be near when it seems afar; so stick to the fight when you're hardest hit - it's when things seem worst, you must not quit. More Food for Thought on Quitting  Before success comes in any man's life, he's sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps some failures. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit. That's exactly what the majority of men do. Napoleon Hill  Once you learn to quit, it becomes a habit. Vince Lombardi
The best way to eat for gut healing Gut continues to be a buzz-word in the world of nutrition and holistic health. More and more research continues to come out on how our gut health has a bigger impact than we once thought when it comes to our immune system, metabolism and overall health.  And here’s the thing: There are a lot of gut health promotion programs out there (and more surely to hit the market soon) that offer up eating plans and supplemental treatment. But ironically, many of the recommendations within them could actually negatively impact your gut health.  Life Time has its own gut-healing program, and one of our most frequently asked questions we get is this:   “Can I take the GUT.FIXSM supplements without following the 30-day meal plan?”  The GUT.FIX kit is designed to help our internal gut with nourishment to help digest and absorb the food we are eating. And on its own, it’s surely to help boost overall digestive health and function while supporting our immune system.  But, if your digestive health is already compromised or having any sort of issues digesting and absorbing nutrients, you might need more support than the supplements in our kit.  So what are the key components of gut healing eating? Below I’ve outlined the key components in our GUT.FIX eating plan that includes why each recommendation works for most people trying to heal and nourish their gut. If you’ve dabbled in any sort of gut promotion eating plan, (without getting the results you were looking for) consider these gut-healing recommendations:  Eliminate the Biggest Offenders Gluten, corn, dairy, soy, eggs and peanuts. There’s a reason these foods cause the most common food allergies within our population. We not only are overly exposed to these foods within the processed standard American diet, but they’re also the top offenders when it comes to foods that disrupt our digestive function and immunity. Also on the elimination list, processed vegetable oils (hello pro-inflammatory omega-6’s), beans, legumes and lentils (their high fiber can cause distress), foods high in added sugars, and specific nuts (cashews, hazelnuts and pistachios) that are harder to digest.  More Eating, Less Drinking Although we recommend getting ample water throughout the day, (optimal is half your weight in ounces) focus on drinking that fluid before or after your meals, but never during.  This not only will help you focus on our other mealtime recommendations, (focus on the food, eat slowly) but will also make it easier for your body to break down and digest the meal. Alcohol, coffee and tea should be eliminated as they can disrupt digestion and absorption of nutrients needed to heal your gut.  Rotate Your Proteins When talking food intolerances and allergies, it is the protein within the food that the body is reacting to. As Americans, we tend to eat the same foods over and over so that when we compromise our gut health, we might start reacting to things that are common in our diet. Because we don’t have a huge variety of different proteins in our diet, (beef and chicken are most common) this food category specifically can be the most at-risk for a food sensitivity. The GUT.FIX meal plan rotates different proteins (or foods that are biologically similar) to not only provide variety but also help prevent a food sensitivity or allergy from emerging. To practice a rotation protocol with proteins, you can eat a specific category of protein (let’s say chicken) on a day and throughout the day, but then can’t again until at least four days later.  This allows your body to full digest and eliminate it along with any potential antibodies.  Cook Your Vegetables Vegetables provide ample amounts of vitamins and minerals along with some of the best sources of dietary fiber (needed to support optimal digestive function). But if your gut is feeling compromised, veggies in their raw form can cause additional distention and related symptoms, (excess gas, etc) making them not so desirable to consume. Eating cooked vegetables is a great way to make sure your body is getting the desirable nutrients and also making it easier for your body to digest and break them down. After a couple weeks of eating cooked vegetables, (and taking the gut supporting supplements) start incorporating a serving of raw vegetables each day so you can ease into them while having the opportunity to test your tolerance.  Reduction Of Other Top Offenders So here’s the thing. If you eliminate the biggest offenders listed above, you’ll be in great shape to support your gut health. But, there are a few other food groups that are often deemed healthy (and ironically promoted as gut-healing foods in other gut health programs) that can actually prevent your gut from fully healing if you are reacting to them. These groups of foods include FODMAPS, (short chained fermented carbohydrates like garlic and onion) all nuts and seeds, all grains, (even the gluten-free ones like wild rice) fermented foods (like sauerkraut) and nightshade vegetables (bell peppers, white potatoes, etc.). We include the lists of each of these food categories with our online program to make sure users have all the information they need. Plus, we provide the recommendation of the “best tolerated” meal menu, being free of each of these top offenders for the best results and relief.  Include Gut-Nourishing Foods Although eliminating problematic foods is helpful for any gut-healing program, the best ones also include foods that help nourish and heal the gut. The idea is to fill your plate up with foods that will support your gut and overall health, such as quality meats, cooked veggies and certain fruits, and beneficial oils that will all provide needed nutrients that are easy and readily absorbable to your body. When you take away all of the offenders that are hard on your digestive track, your body has an easier time soaking up the nourishing components of a quality diet.  Because we believe in the meal recommendations so heavily, we included a 30-day meal plan with the GUT.FIX kit’s online program to help overcome as many barriers as possible. The meal plan is designed to not only provide variety, but also nourishment and time to help support gut function and healing so that your body can work it’s best.  Is your gut due for a GUT.FIX? You can do anything for 30 days and your body will thank you for it.

Weight Loss Challenge Been on a weight loss journey officially and seriously since December 2010 now with two of my friends. It's been going week for the most part, but I seem to have hit a stumbling block. I've nearly lost a stone now and for the past three weeks, I've stayed the same until this week, where I gained a pound. Yikes! So, I'm putting this on my blog in the hope that this will make me accountable. My friends and I weigh ourselves every Wednesday at our local Boots Pharmacy, then we send a picture of our weigh in result printouts to our BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) group. We then compare the current weeks weight to the previous week's. Depending on whether we lose, gain or stay the same we'll congratulate, encourage or suggest new strategies for the following week. I have to say that this group has been wonderful. This is the most weight I have ever managed to lose. And for the most part we've all managed to stay on course. At times when we've felt weak, we just start up a conversation on the group. We share recipes and salads. We also confess!!! Lol. We tell each other when we're about to fall off the wagon, or that we fell off the wagon and fess up about everything we've eaten. Being in the group is not just effective, but also a lot of fun. With that said, I shall be keeping this blog updated from now on. I will try to blog on our weigh in days (Wednesdays) or shortly after.  Here are a few of my weigh in results and some of the things pictures I've shared with the group. The last weigh in print was taken yesterday. I have gained 1lb, which I'm not too pleased with. So my challenge is to drop another 2lbs over the next week. I shall be attempting to achieve this by replacing some meals with just soup over the next few days. I'm determined to stay on course. See you in a week or so. ;)
Day 46 - Frantic bid for weight loss I can honestly say I've done everything I can to help myself to a good WI on Monday. But still I have no faith (which according to wise LLC is the sole reason the weight isn't just dropping off - v scientific that). I have walked in every day, I have an active weekend planned, I have drunk 6l of water every day, I have drunk 2 cups of nettle tea every day (bleurgh!), I have taken lots of water flavourings and added in psyllium husks. Given my poor results over the last 3 weeks though I am looking at 9 1/2lb loss needed to get back on track for the 1st a month promised. I didn't lose that in my first week so it seems very unlikely. And with the exception of the tea and husks - none of this is new. I have to say that my rings are tight today though. They have been slightly loose so possibly there's something in the theory that I'm retaining water - but this is with the extra water and the pond-water tea. I'm so anxious about all of this that it's seeping into my whole life. I have heard anxiety makes you slim but in that case I should be having to eat cream cakes to keep weight on! And that would be dreadful. Ahem. Today in my super-greedy office we are having a cheese and wine afternoon. Cheese is something that I've really missed - although not something I was fixated on before LL. I bought some Colston Bassett stilton from Neals Yard Dairy (the best Stilton from the best cheese shop ever!) as my contribution and could weep at the prospect that I can't taste it. I've told them that my mum is cooking dinner for me and the b/f tonight so I mustn't go there full up. Of course, she is cooking dinner - but for b/f, not me. And she's made him one of her amazing homemade quiches for lunch since he's over there slaving on her garden on a day's leave today (bless him). I don't like shop-bought quiche (or anything pastry-y) but my mum's quiche is sublime. But I have mushroom soup - wanna swop?! Will be worth it if I can actually lose the f**ing 9 1/2lbs - that's what I keep telling myself. Will next get a chance to update this blog after the next WI, week 7, halfway through. Think of me.
"And I'm on my way, don't know where I'm going but I'm on my way" The countdown begins....well it pretty much started when I got here but its for real now with only 8 full days left to be in Australia, 6 of which will be in Townsville and the other 2 in Surfers Paradise (Gold Coast) visiting Steve who I have not seen since my grand entrance into this country. To say that the time went by fast is an understatement...it flew. To be honest, my whole life seems like it moves so fast. When Jay came to visit we were talking about how we've grown up so quick....he'll be in grad school for 5 or 6 years away from home, Jackie's going to high school, and I will be done with college in one year. When did that all happen? I've learned more about myself in these 5 months away from home than I can even begin to explain...I've been pretty reflective in the past few weeks with the closing of a chapter in my life. While I've been in Australia it seems like I have had two lives- one life that is at home and a new life here in Australia. I've been relatively the same person all around but I've separated them- I have friends at home and friends here. I have school at home and school here. The funny thing is, the life I have here has been so independent. Not to say that I wasn't independent in the past- I have always considered myself someone who can take care of myself and is always my own person. I guess what I mean to say is that I've matured a lot here over the past 5 months and it's a great feeling. The two lives I have are of course intertwined and it's not that I have two lives- it's just that I have two totally different experiences. Being away has let me find myself a little better and get in tune with what I want out of my life. I've learned what is really important in life and the things that are not worth the time of day to even think about. My life isn't crystal clear- life never is that way- I'm just as much of a mess as I've always considered myself- but I guess an enlightened mess if that makes any sense whatsoever? I've realized that in the past I have not been the happiest of people...I'm not quite sure why that is...maybe because I've been set back a lot and I put too much pressure on knowing what is going to happen in the future...I always have to have a plan. I guess thats the nature of my perfectionist personality (thanks Dad...lol). But the truth really is that life is not static and it changes no matter what you try to plan for. It's kind of nice not knowing what's going to happen and just live life day to day. Do the things that make you happy. I missed out on that for the past year I think- I worked too hard both in school and out of school. I got a perfect GPA last semester. I am proud of myself for that but at the same time get mad because I wasn't really that happy. I stopped doing the things that once defined my happiness (horseback riding, dancing, singing) and stopped spending time with some real quality people. I don't know where I was last semester....somewhere in textbooks and sleeping a lot. I guess part of me is always waiting around for life to happen- but the thing is life IS happening now. I am "in it" so to speak. Now that I am "awakened" again, there is a lot I want to do and a lot I'm going to try to work on as a person. I feel like I have all of this pent up energy to release. It's weird- like a caged bird who just wants to get out and fly away. I always wonder what it's like to be a bird I will acknowledge the fact that I have been the worst blogger on the planet- well maybe not the worst but still pretty bad. I have to be in the mood to blog and also have the time. Sometimes I think it's a waste of time because I could be out doing stuff but other times I think it's a wonderful way to record and remember the memories and be extremely reflective. You just get caught up and twisted into life but it's good to take a moment to slow down a little. I've gone through a lot since I last really wrote a blog entry about my adventures. I think it was right before I went to Sydney for the first time. I'll let the pictures do the talking... First day in Sydney- a really nice day with lots of lovely seagulls Biggest rush of my life- so far ;-) Being a tourist Luke and Nelson are really amazing blokes Being all scientific during reef fish surveys on Orpheus Island I feel the most connected with the earth when I am here Even the smallest sea shells and grains of sand are significant So proud of mom for hiking Castle Hill! Crystal Creek- things only appear infinitely beautiful when you see them with worthwhile people Never forget how important family is- ever Life is lovely Oh, I'm going to miss the silliness Jay I seriously wish that I was a fish sometimes- I felt so in touch with nature here Second greatest thrill of my life One of the coolest people ever Quality times going to the Tav Mission accomplished So what now? I have 8 days left. I have one final left- History- I think I did well on my other three finals. They were tough and all essay formatted. I can't wait to be over with school. I honestly can't believe I have another year of school to finish when I go back. I feel worn out. I'm looking forward to starting new chapters in my life. Maybe after school I'll work doing something totally not related or I'll live somewhere different and new. Australia has opened my eyes- there are so many places in the world I want to see and so many things I want to do. The possibilities are endless and I am not going to limit myself to any of them. Life is what you make of it. I'm looking forward to going home- I can't wait to see my family again- especially the ones who didn't come visit me! It's been way too long. I'm excited for my summer internship and to finish school. No doubt I've met some worthwhile people here that I am going to dearly miss. I suppose my feelings are in a limbo right now- not happy, not sad....not yet anyways. I'm actually looking forward to the journey ahead- the 14 hours plane ride that I used to complain about sounds kinda nice now- I'll get some more "me time" and read the book Jay gave to me- "The Greatest Show on Eart" by Richard Dawkins and read up on my summer project literature. And no doubt be listening to the music that describes life so perfectly- or at least the music that describes my life that I've been obsessed with listening to lately- Coldplay and John Mayer and anything Latin, like usual. I just finished the book "The House of the Spirits" by Isabel Allende which I HIGHLY suggest anyone to read- it was fabulous. I am mildly obsessed with her writing. I've started dancing again here- something I'm going to keep up when I get back to the states- Salsa dancing that is...salsa, merengue, bachata, and this new style called zouk. I even bought myself an early 21st birthday present- a pair of nice latin ballroom shoes. I'm going to start doing the things I love again- I don't know how I got away from them in the first place. Tonight is salsa at this place called Casa downtown and I'll be going to salsa again on Monday at the Watermark- it will be my last night for dancing. I have a Yongala dive trip planned again with Melissa- it got cancelled for Saturday but should still be on for Monday- cross my fingers! A friend's birthday is on Sunday so I'll be going out for drinks that night too. Just trying to savor my last moments here with the people that have been truly awesome. This is the end for now but definitely not the end of the friendships- paths will cross again if I have anything to say about it. Anyways thats about all my heart feels like pouring out at the moment- I will write a final entry to talk about the last week and gold coast which I'm super excited about! Thank you Australia- I'm starting to feel myself again. Love you all- see you soon!
Working On My Running - Making a Commitment I think I've finally found a way to commit to a 5K - with no looking back. My running really never got off the ground before, so to speak.  I still do a lot of walking and spinning, but even though I've wanted to "graduate" to running, I always let other things get in the way.  My weird schedule and lack of time are two of my biggest excuses, and while they do have some merit I know there's a way to work around them.   There has to be.  I can't let outside stuff get into my head and stop me from moving forward. So I made a commitment that will force me to follow through in the only way I knew how - publicly.  I'm a local columnist for my town's Sun News, and a lot of people in my community read my words.  When I discovered that North Ridgeville is hosting a new race on November 1st AND the money from it would go back into my community, I decided to jump in feet first. No, that's not quite right - I prayed about it first - THEN added my feet into the mix.  AND I wrote about it. With so many people reading about my commitment to run, I know I have support.  Friends, neighbors, and coworkers will know about it, which will help keep me accountable to myself and my goal.  The dream is not just in my head...it's out there for the whole world to read! With the race being at the beginning of November, I've given myself plenty of time to work up to 3.1 miles. I am starting now - not waiting until October to train, but gradually getting stronger day by day for a few months before debuting my stride in front of a crowd.  This is not something you cram for like a big exam, and trying to do it last minute could only cause injury or stress.  Since I am going to do this, I want to do it the right way. Please check out my column "Running down a dream: North Ridgeville News and Musings" and follow my progress both in the Sun News and this blog.  I will keep you posted on how things are going....and I appreciate your support whether you live in my town or read my words across the miles!
Note As I am going on a short holiday, this blog will not be updated on the 21st of November, but instead be updated on Wednesday the 22nd of November, and then again on Monday the 27th of November.
OK׳’ג‚¬ֲ¦ SOO I BACK Hi liars,  Happy new year, Merry Christmas ( it׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s never too late to say this). I know i haven׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t been consistent but I guess I just post when I want because it׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s my little space on the internet. I am sorry, hopefully, you have missed me probably not.  Ok so I officially have given up on Tumblr because I made a new account and I can׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t get into it which is great so I am really sorry but yeah. I guess I to aesthetic for Tumblr haha. But just because Tumblr gave up on me does not mean I gave up on the internet I found something else to do׳’ג‚¬ֲ¦ Pinterest. I am on a full grind, pinning everywhere and anywhere, slowly tidying up my boards as I go because I have had that Pinterest account for too long before you have sub-boards. OG member right here.  Also, my internet has been absolutely rubbish for months now because TalkTalk thinks that making the route break six months before the contract runs out will make us get another contract. No. My internet is so bad that I had to move my laptop downstairs and physically connect to the internet, which means no more late night movie sessions I actually have to go to bed. With my great Wifi, I have had to use more of my data which 3GB so for the past few months I have been running low or running out a week before I get a new set. Anyway on February the 8th we are switching to BT it would have Virgin but virgin doesn׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t have lines in my area (yet).  Art-wise I feel like I can׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t draw anything but I am still drawing because I think its just a phrase. Netflix has been mine new best friends I am currently watching call the midwife, That 70s show, Riverdale, Something in the rain and Oh my venus. I have basically binged watch Call the Midwife I am halfway through season 3. Recently on Netflix, they added my childhood favourite movie About a boy I had the movie on VHS. If you haven׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t watched it go get yourself some tea preferably herbal and watch it.  Anyway good night my loves  xoxo  4teen
When you're grieving at Christmas Hiiiiiiiii, Yes, it has been a while...for good reason this time.  I still intend on catching you up on the last few months, but today's not that day.  In brief though, as at last Weigh In Wednesday (today's Saturday), I've lost 19.3kg since resetting on the 1st July.  The way I've been eating this week will probably make next Wednesday's weigh in go in the 'wrong' direction, but let's talk about that later. I'm super proud of the 19.3kg, and while it's taken almost 6 months, that does not bother me at all.  The learning's and changes I've made in these months are worth their 'weight' in gold.  My blog topic list still stands, don't you worry, and I will fill in the gaps. But, as the title of this post says, this one is not focused on battling chocolate or sharing my meal prep.  (Although both of those things have gone out the window this week!) As the title suggests, I feel the need to write about grief at Christmas time. Before I go on; just for the record, I am not qualified in anything about this topic.  I'm not a psychologist, psychiatrist, counsellor, doctor or medical practitioner of any kind, and I don't have the answers.  For anyone needing grief or any type of counselling, please contact a crisis organisation in your area.  In Australia, we have Lifeline: www.lifeline.org.au and many others.  I just googled "international crisis contacts" and a whole range came up, including a few sites that list numbers to call in a whole array of countries.  I don't want to miss any countries out, so instead of directing you somewhere, I ask that you google it.  If you can access my blog, I imagine you can access Google.  This post is not a "how to cope" guide, or anything along those lines, and I am not a professional in this area.  I hope I have made that clear.  If you need help, please reach out, as there ARE people who can help. This post is simply about me chatting about how I am feeling.  Maybe some people will be able to relate.  I imagine many of you will. It's a little bit off topic for me, in a way.  But while my predominant content is all about weight loss and fitness gain and everything that comes with those things, I'm very much human, and I do have a lot more things in my life other than trying to lose weight. :) When I was 9, my Dad gave me my first diary.  I wrote it in most days, and I continued until  my early 20's.  My diaries from the ages of 9 to 11 were very much factual, about what I did each day, like record keeping.  I traveled a lot during those 2 years, so they were kind of the style of travel journals - what happened.  Some days were simply "Today we played."  It was pretty deep. :) When I hit 12 though, the writing style changed, and wow, now those diaries are hot property.  They started with entries titled "My first bra" and "The first time I shaved my legs" and went on from there.  I found I mainly wrote when I was really emotional, in whichever end of the glorious human emotion spectrum I was in.  I overcame a lot of hurdles in my early 20's, and as such, my writing settled down, as I guess my need to, also diminished. I feel that's quite like my blog - I find writing really therapeutic: when I feel the desire to. And going by the title of this post, it's pretty clear that the desire is, sadly, there. Yes, I'm grieving, and yes, it's Christmas. And it's really hard.   I know I'm not the only one to ever go through grief at Christmas time, and certainly not the only one who's going through it this year.  You'd perhaps think that knowing this would be some strange comfort, in that I'm not alone.  However it's one of the rare things in life that you wish you were alone in: I wouldn't wish grief on anyone.  It makes me even more sad to think of how many others are having the worst time right now. Grief or sadness at any time of year is hard, but why is it that Christmas seems to make it more heightened, or more unwanted?  Is it the expectation of tradition that Christmas is supposed to be a happy time?  Is it that we miss our loved ones more on special occasions?  I've always declared Christmas Day as my favourite day of the year.  But I have to question myself on this at the moment. Christmas carols lyrics such as: "'Tis the season to be jolly" "What a bright time, it's the right time, to rock the night away" "It’s the most wonderful time of the year" jump out at me more than ever, ringing through my ears for hours after hearing them played in Coles.  Is it pressure?  Or is it just a reminder of Christmas's where I have been overwhelmingly happy, and I'm reminded that I'm not so much this year? One of my relatives passed away a few weeks ago, and this week I lost a really close friend in a really devastating, confusing way.  I was doing pretty well - actually very well, but there's no rules on grief, and I was starkly reminded of this on Thursday. I'm trying so hard to focus on the blessings in my life.  This is certainly not hard.  I am completely blessed, and tonight (it's just clocked over to Christmas Eve as I type this) and tomorrow I am going to be under the same roof as my entire immediate family for the first time in two years.  Part of my immediate family are 5 kids under 5, who are my world.  They are so precious and one of two Miss Five's melted my heart today when she showed me how she's practicing how to sleep while Santa visits.  My family love me and support me and I cannot begin to describe how blessed that I know I am. And that's just for a start. But grief seems to be able to overtake or skew the view of even the greatest of blessings that we have. Grief doesn't just come from loss.  My heart is breaking for friends of mine who have very recently separated and are facing their first Christmas as a broken family.  For an older friend who when I asked what she's doing on Christmas Day, she said "nothing" (because her friends are doing other things and she doesn't have any close family).  For a few close people to me who have just been diagnosed with cancer.  For multiple friends who are struggling to conceive.  For a dear friend whose 3 year old daughter is going through chemo. Cruel things happen all year round but Christmas time it just seems to enhance the pain of it, and I can't pinpoint why. I've found it hard to find the Christmas spirit for the last few years.  I surprised myself by 'finding' it a couple of weeks ago.  But events since then have shook that up a lot. One thing that is helping is to 'give'.  For me it's been in the form of an unplanned over-surge in my Christmas shopping.  I'm not materialistic and of course I know that there's so many kind ways we can give (give back).  But with my focus out the window right now, buying far and wide just happened to occur.  My bank balance may not agree, but it's made me feel good as I've bought and wrapped. As I said earlier, this post is not about advice, rather than just sharing how I'm doing at the moment.  And that makes me realise another thing that's helping me - writing. My eating has gone out the window; I haven't cared about what I've been putting in my mouth (hence why I said I'm sure that the scales will go in the wrong direction next week.  But I haven't cared - it's been like "whatever".  I'm sure I'll pull myself out of it and start making smarter choices, but I'm not about to put any pressure on, especially on Christmas Eve! I really thought I was going somewhere with this post...but it appears not.  I think I thought that writing it out will help me gain perspective or...something.  But I guess it's more of a chatty post, with no resolution or advice or direction.  Just "blurgh": this is how it is. What I will say is that if you too are grieving, then please know that I'm thinking of you and am sending you my love.  If you need to, please contact an organisation in your area, or call a friend or family member.  I've been (unusually) very open with my family, and I'm sure they'll cut me some slack if I'm not myself tomorrow.  We can get very good at hiding things, but sometimes it's a relief to just open up and know that it's okay to not be okay.  Maybe some of the things that have helped me (trying to focus on my blessings, giving to others, writing, and looking towards the new year) may help you think of ideas for yourself. And if you're just feeling sad, that's okay.  Never deny yourself feelings of any kind.  Sometimes we know that we are blessed but it still hurts.  Appreciating what we have doesn't mean you can't feel what you need to feel.  Let's get through this day as best as we can, and make allowances for ourselves.  The Christmas spirit is still there, and while we may not be feeling it as much this year, I pray that it comforts you in some way. I know what I said before about Christmas carol lyrics, but there is one that I want to share with you.  It's a carol called "The Christmas Hope", and a snippet of the lyrics are below. No matter what your circumstances are, whether you're grieving, feeling sad, are alone, or if things aren't going as you thought they would, I hope these words comfort you and give you a sprinkle of hope tomorrow. Merry Christmas to you and your loved ones, whether they're with you tomorrow or not xoxo "Hope is a present A gift freely given To all who receive And open their hearts Hope is a promise For a better tomorrow In a world filled with sorrow We always have hope" (The Christmas Hope)
Tea So this morning my mum brought me a cup of tea in bed and it was the sweetest, most delicious tea ever and I just marvelled at the fact that mum is the only one who knows instinctively that I like my tea 30% sugar and doesn't judge me for it. I believe tea is a magical thing, definitely on par with rainbows, kittens and books. If tea could be worshipped I would totally worship it. Maybe it's the British in me. But my dad hates tea, so I like to stare at him menacingly as he stirs his coffee. On the bright side (there's always a bright side with tea) I get a cupboard all to myself for my tea collection, which currently contains my own tea pot bought from a charity shop, several mugs with kittens and patterns and phrases like 'keep calm and party hard' on them, 4 boxes of loose leaf tea- peppermint, creme brulee, rose hip and a herbal blend meant for studying. Tea is good. Here are some things I like about tea: - when you know how to make it properly by warming the pot first and it makes the tea 20% more delicious - when you've finally mastered balancing the ratio of milk to tea - reading a good book with a cup of tea - making tea whenever there's a crisis to calm everyone down - everything's classier with tea - tea before bed - tea in the morning - tea in the afternoon - tea and tumblr - tea leaf reading - finding new ingredients to add to tea like cinnamon - chocolate tea - chai tea - having tea with your grandma - having tea with your significant other - when it's raining, curling up on the floor with a blanket, a book and a cup of tea - tea is just made of magic XOX Nay
We're Trying To Crash Your Computer. They said this about 5-6 days ago, since then every day I am having to run my computer with a scan going nearly all the time. Every day there is between 9-12 trojans, worms, or malaware of some sort. I also have a video of my car to put on and the damage they have done to it, they said "They were trying to bleach me", this is when my dog and I were being sprayed with chemicals both in our house (which I had to walk out of) and in my car when I was in it, but am having non-stop problems with getting the page for the camera gear to open properly so I can edit the video a bit shorter. Will try it on the next post.
England v Australia - the shape-up at the half way point A series between Australia and England is renowned for its pain and passion, ultimately turning the great theatres of cricket into a coliseum-esque stage for the ecstasy and heartache of an Ashes series to be played out in front of adoring crowds of millions.  This summer the treat is once again Australia, but the fight is not played out over 25 days and is not for the urn, instead cricket followers are experiencing a concept wholly new ג€“ an ODI series against a youthful looking Australian side just clutching their world no1 ranking.  Australiaג€™s recently mixed bag of ODI results show that by no means do they dominate their opponents as they did in the early-mid noughties.  Old campaigner Brett Lee is as destructive as those days, but the Australia around him has changed.  Their batting line up fizzles out beyond the fifth batsman and it is credit to Englandג€™s bowlers that, even without Jimmy Anderson on Sunday, they were able to prevent the Australians accumulating a big score.   Only Brett Lee and Michael Clarke seem able to provide the knock-out punches, a last reminder of the days when Australia bulldozed their way through cricket matches.  Nonetheless, the visitors are providing an interesting warm-up act to what is likely to be seen in the two 2013 Ashes series and the English fans are lapping up the ג€˜new youfג€™ paraded by Clarke in this series.  Also, the movement in the Australian team between Lord's and the Kia Oval, Forest replaced Smith and David Hussey dropped a place in the batting order, reflected Englandג€™s stamp of authority over their opponents.  Mitchell Johnson, coming in for Cummins, quite literally wobbled under the pressure of the fanג€™s ג€˜love to hateג€™ relationship, bowling three no-balls and not completing his allocated 10 overs.  This ODI series, so far, has an air of expectation about it, as both sides expect to win. Australia only appear as the underdog, but if England were to steal their world ranking from them with a 5-0 whitewash it would be an extraordinary feat.  By going 2-0 up in the series England are on track to hold the top world ranking in every form of the game, the first side in history to do so, but Australia are not out of this series and could still clinch victory.  
RESULTS... Hey everyone, not been on here for a while so thought i'd up date on my recent MRI results. I had an MRI on 10th December 2012 and the results show subtle growth.  I don't know as yet what comes next as i am now awaiting my appointment to see my oncologist.﻿
The Start! Yes, finally I have started this ridiculous and mind you long overdue aim of finally getting fit. The target is one year from now (to be exact 05/05/2012), I will have shed the three and a half stone, maintained not only the weight but the excercise habits that I plan to develop along the way. One year and no going back. So readers, if you are out there: I need your support and will very very very much be grateful if from now and then you could look in on me and ask me how I'm doing. I will answer and I will be here each and every day writing on my progress and letting you know how it all goes. One thing I won't be doing is probably sharing the name of the weight loss method because then it would just be free advertisement (and as although I am known at The Greenwich Gazette for my love all things free whether in giving or receiving I think this one would be too much even by my standards). I know it is a safe method of losing weight. Tried and tested. so I will refer to the weight loss plan as "The Plan" because ultimately that is what it is. Plain and simple. Tomorrow a new dawn begins and I look forward to where this journey will take me. I expect you to be there with me each and every step of the way. Thank you all in advance.
Lifeand a Marathon Weekend Read As most of you will know I injured my knee a month ago and because I am stubborn I delayed going to the doctor until last week, thinking it would just get better by itself. Alas that did not happen and I am booked in to have and ultrasound next week to see what is actually wrong. The result of my stubbornness is having very painful knees that hardly bend and I am beginning to wonder if I have inadvertently done more damage. So basically this has led to my days being filled with a very painful work experience, having to stand almost all day on sore knees and being too drained at night to do much more than sit in front of the TV barely able to stay awake. My weekends have been very similar to my evenings with the exception of being able to start and finish reading a recommendation from my boss, Shantaram by  Gregory David Roberts, which I read over a two day period, much to the awe of my 13 year old. This was a marathon for me at over 900 pages! Although I must confess while I enjoyed the first three quarters of the book I did skim read the last quarter as I found myself losing interest. I can't see much of a change over the next two weeks, but hopefully the scan on my knee and the subsequent doctors visit will shed some light and relief onto my health and things will then begin to return to some sort of normality. I find the forced resting to be frustrating despite that when I am able to do whatever I like all I want to do is sit around and read and watch TV. The fact that I do not have the choice grates on my nerves.
The “I Don’t Want to Workout” Training Run  It is no secret I have been a total slacker since the Disney Princess 1/2 Marathon the end of February, heck I owe a trip and race report – I will do one I promise AND I have only run like 2 times.  I signed up for the Atlanta Peachtree Road Race 10k Lottery – HUGE race 60, 000 runners July 4th, fun time and to be honest I was hoping to not get in. I mean its hot, has some serious hills, the logistics of dealing with the start and end, blah blah blah. I am toying with doing a 1/2 Marathon in August here in Atlanta – yes that is nuts heat wise, but its flat……SO when I got in the Lottery last week I decided I needed to start my 3 runs a week training again. The Peachtree works in great with that 1/2 marathon as far as preparing distance wise and calendar wise.  This is week 1 of getting back to it -today was run 2 of 3 for the week. We went to Disney on Ice Treasure Trove last night and had a blast, but it was a late night so me and the 5 year old princess slept in – and she skipped preschool.  This means I had to go gym since I just can’t leave her alone while I run.  I put on my Disney Princess tech shirt to try to cheer me up as I was not into doing this today and headed to the gym.  The goal: 30 minutes “speed work”.  I set the treadmill at Random Workout level 3.  I started with a 3 minute walk warmup and then did my 1 minute run/ 1 minute walk intervals. I paced the run started in at 6mph and the walks at 4mph.  With each walk I added 0.1mph goal to get up to 7 and then go down. The idea is with each run interval I get faster.  Here’s the thing, I was NOT into today. Ate crap yesterday, didn’t have enough water so over drank before my workout today “slosh, slosh, slosh”.  I felt my big belly bouncing around – lets face it I have been eating JUNK lately and I was just tired.  YET I PUSHED ON.  I got up to 6.6mph runs and was like PLEASE BE OVER…..so the next run interval one I said to heck with it and went up to 6.8 for 30 seconds then 7.  I was SO tired some of my walk intervals were longer than a minute as my breathing was fast. The last run interval….I heard Bob and Jillian from Biggest Loser saying in my head “Last Chance Workout……” – the nice Bob from previous seasons…..and said to heck with this, the first 30 sec I did 7mph, the last I did 8mph – yowza that was fast.  I think I looked like a spaz those 30 seconds, but got it done!  Felt great to be done as I would rate this workout a total BLAH – I was SO not into it.  While I much prefer to be outside, I do love how I can push myself for short bursts on the treadmill. Now, to work on my diet – I need to start feeding my body some good stuff….oh and get sleep too.  Hey, but I am so happy to be on track with my scheduled workouts this week. One more then I kick it up a notch! The gym has got some awesome looking Core Classes starting soon, def will give them a try.  Happy Running, Walking or Some Combo thereof !

Weight loss and the Biggest Loser: What you really need to know about the NY Times article Patients, Facebook friends, and friends of friends contacted me in horror after reading the NY Times article on the Biggest Loser. Weight re-gain is inevitable. Most if not all of it.  And metabolic rate is screwed too. The control you believed you had? Doomed to dissolve. The hope you were given that you'd finally made it to your goal size or weight—or were getting closer—shattered. Overweight, obese, underweight or average size—the feelings knew no size boundaries. Fear. Anxiety. Hopelessness. Panic. The pain of regain extended well beyond the 14 Biggest Loser contestants studied and their loved ones. It was felt by those of you who shared their struggle and their joy and sought inspiration from this outrageous, extremist show.  The NY Times summarized the research: by 6 years after the show’s end, all but one participant studied had either regained some weight or gained beyond their starting weight; 4 contestants are now heavier than before they tortured themselves with this unsettling weight loss regime. I know how you're feeling. Nearly all have slower metabolisms now than at program’s start—over 600 calories less on average— with the biggest loser, Cahill at a loss of 800 calories burned per day; he now has to eat 800 calories less per day to maintain the same weight compared to at the start of the program. Many reduced their weights enough to improve their health, but the struggle to maintain the loss was constant and painful—physically and psychologically. Where’s our anger at this abuse? Four to 6 hours daily exercise was commonplace, with Cahill reporting 7 hours/day while on the show. Two or more hours included intense cardio workouts. And their intake? 1000-1200 calories was not unusual—an outrageous restriction even if the obese individuals were sedentary. That’s right. Just breathing or being at rest they would lose weight at that calorie level given average heights and starting weights. The degree of starvation was shameful and irresponsible. A set up for failure for sure. And did I mention there are now reports by participants of taking stimulants (provided to them by the program) to accelerate the weight loss—like ephedra and Adderall?  It is simply abusive to lose weight the way they were directed to for the public’s entertainment. The extreme calorie deprivation resulted in a hormonally induced hunger and subsequent binge eating. No doubt, great shame and embarrassment resulted from their regain as they blamed themselves for their “failure”. Unfortunately, people replicate this self-abuse with crazy diets all the time, believing they can just jump-start their weight loss and then sustain it. Wrong, wrong wrong.  What can you learn from this Biggest Loser study? Yes, metabolic rate does slow with weight loss. This is not news. You knew it. You knew that when you were dieting and the weight loss you’d hope would continue simply didn’t happen. Your weight would plateau even though you were doing just what you were doing before. Even though you were “being good”. And so you made an adjustment. You’d eat a little less or exercise a little more or use behaviors like purging. And what resulted? More frustration, less “success” with weight loss.  It may be time to be more realistic. And for many if not most of you, rebound overeating or binge eating occurred. Because you’re a failure? Surely not! Because it wasn’t sustainable. Because you felt deprived—hungry, unsatisfied, fatigued, unfocused, vulnerable. Because hormone levels fought against you, as leptin levels—which helps us feel satiated—dropped with weight loss.  While the number of study participants—a mere 14 individuals—was small—the results were enormous. All but one regained significant weight. Yet the big news from this piece was the extent of the metabolic rate drop and the duration that it was sustained—observed when last checked 6 years after the end of the show! Now that’s scary.  What does this really mean for you?  While we don’t have all the answers, it appears that the degree of restriction impacts the outcome. Meaning, more rapid loss, more rapid gain. The “biggest loser”, Danny Cahill, had the greatest drop in metabolic rate—down 800 calories/day. He also regained the fastest, based on the NY Times graph accompanying the article. Deny your body and it’s gonna do what it needs to preserve yourself—it’ll try to slow the engine down, to conserve, to save some fuel for another day, to burn fewer calories. Yes, it does appear proportional. More moderate reductions in rate of weight loss, less drop in metabolic rate.  Is my metabolism ruined forever? The degree and duration of metabolic drop reported in the Biggest Loser research is simply not seen in other studies—a drop of 3-5% is more common. And most studies show that this drop reverses with increased food intake.  Living with anorexia?  Fear not—you have not permanently messed things up. The famous Minnesota Starvation Experiment demonstrated what those who treat eating disorders know from practice—that metabolic rate rapidly increases with re-feeding. (But continue to starve yourself and yes, your metabolic rate will be suppressed.) It requires a lot more calories than we’d expect for underfed individuals to restore weight. Ask any parent who is helping to renourish their child with anorexia.  So please don’t be too quick to assume your fate. How do we know metabolic rate increases in this population? In addition to the Starvation Experiment and inpatient studies using indirect calorimetry—a  measure of resting metabolic rate or calories burned at rest, we also can see it indirectly—from increases in heart rate, body temperature and hormone levels. I don’t have anorexia. I just diet to lose weight.  What does this mean for me? “Just dieting” still lowers metabolic rate. If you are as extreme as the contestants, you may need to acknowledge your fate. If you are expecting rapid loss to be maintainable, think again. Torturing your body with hours of exercise each day as many of them did (or any amount, quite frankly, that leaves you starving) and/or restricting your eating and denying your hunger will fail you.  Banning these? Time to change your approach  to weight management. Feeling deprived by omitting foods that satisfy you will lead you nowhere. Besides the reduced metabolic rate, the resulting deprivation leads to binge eating. And binge eating contributes to significant excess in calories and weight regain. Hopelessness follows, leads to the “what the heck effect” and eating recklessly. It all adds up to significant weight regain. And with chronic restricting, there’s also a loss of muscle mass which further reduces metabolic rate. So now what? Using more sensible, less extreme, more behavioral approaches to take charge of eating may seem less sexy, but has my vote. An 8 year study on lifestyle change resulted in long term weight loss (in 73% of overweight participants)— but not to the degree you might be hoping for. A 5-10% drop in weight was maintainable without losing sanity, and improved health.  While the Biggest Loser participants tortured themselves dropping huge amounts of weight, and suffered as it rapidly increased, those with practical lifestyle changes lost less to start and after some initial regain, stabilized for years, suggesting better long term outcomes. The Biggest Losers? The study ended at 6 years, but based on the charts most seem to be likely to continue their weight gain trend. So what can you do? Accept more realistic weight goals.  Modest paced weight loss (assuming weight loss is truly needed) may be most sustainable.  A 5-10% weight loss is enough to have a signifiant impact on your health—on blood pressure, blood sugar blood, cholesterol, fitness level and overall well being.  Focus on fitness goals. Regardless of your weight, find ways to move more, setting realistic goals. Address the quality of your intake for health. Include plenty of whole foods including grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and lean protein sources—as well as fatty fish. But allow room for other foods you enjoy—yes, that includes cupcakes. Work on your eating behaviors, as I’ve addressed throughout this blog (see posts labeled mindful eating and binge eating) Cover your ears when your doctor says you must drop to the average BMI if you haven’t seen that place in decades, or ever. Clearly more harm than good will be done. Oh, and stop blaming yourself. Take charge of what you can control without physical or mental distress. And take some steps to love yourself as you are. Thanks for reading. And sorry it's taken so long for a blogpost. Please take the time to share your thoughts--and share this piece with others

Dieting and Metabolism Master your Metabolism by Jonny Bowden, MA, CNS (see more from this expert)  Taken from: http://diet.ivillage.com/issues/imetab/0,,3bc5,00.html  Q I've been dieting constantly on and off for years since I was a teenager, and have lost and gained the same 50 pounds more times than I can count. This last time I gained back even more. Have I ruined my metabolism?  A The idea that people can "ruin" their metabolisms is a very disempowering notion. To put it simply, you can't. You may have some metabolic issues due to yo-yo dieting, and understanding how your personal metabolism works can only help you in your weight loss journey. Let me explain.  For the sake of example, let's say you lose 50 pounds just by dieting. Let's further assume that about half of the weight you lost is fat and half of it is muscle. (These percentages aren't exactly right, but they're good for the purpose of illustration.) You've now lost about 25 pounds of muscle and 25 pounds of fat. Now let's say that you go off the diet and regain that 50 pounds. This time, almost all of the regained weight is going to be fat, and virtually none of it is going to be muscle. So at the end of the day, you weigh the same as before, but your body composition is significantly different. You now have a significantly higher percentage of body fat.  Why does this matter? Simple. Most of your calories are "burned" by muscle tissue. Fat is basically metabolic "dead weight." When you lose a lot of muscle, you lose one of your biggest allies in the war against fat. This shift in body composition is one of the things people refer to when they talk about their metabolism being "ruined" by dieting. To bring your metabolic rate up, one of the best things you can do is regain some of that lost muscle by adding weight training to your routine.  The other thing that frequently happens with yo-yo dieting is that you train your fat storage enzymes to be more efficient. When you repeatedly starve yourself, those enzymes simply become better at their job, an evolutionary strategy meant to keep you alive during times of famine. But by exercising consistently, eating fewer calories than you burn, and by eating the right kind of calories, you can re-train the fat-releasing enzymes to come out of hiding.  And speaking of the right kind of calories ...  Most people in your situation have been trying to lose weight using a low-fat diet. Unfortunately, that's probably exactly what you should not be eating. Low-fat diets are typically high-carb diets, and high-carb diets virtually guarantee that your body will constantly produce high levels of insulin, also known as "the storage hormone." The body does not burn fat in the presence of high levels of insulin. The solution? A moderate-calorie diet that is higher in protein and good fats (such as olive oil) and lower in carbohydrates than your average low-fat diet.  The point is that there are specific positive actions you can take right now to work with almost any metabolic issue you may have as a result of your dieting history. Put these strategies into action right now, and maybe the next time you lose that 50 pounds will be the last time you have to do it.
BMI and Actifry!!! What do you think about BMI?  BMI stands for Body Mass Index, which is a way of seeing if your weight is appropriate for your height. It is calculated by dividing your weight (kg) by your height (mtrs) squared, or you can just look at a chart like the one on the left. It is supposed to correlate with body fat, supposedly the higher your BMI the greater your risk of a number of medical problems. It seems to be what the medical profession go by when calculating how 'fit' you are in their terms. However, one of my friends nephews is a P.E teacher. He is very tall, very broad and very well built.  He is super fit, full of muscle with hardly an ounce of fat on him.  He obviously has a physical job, not only that he works out every day at the gym and goes running 4-5 times a week.  He eats a very healthy diet and watches everything he eats, he is passionate about it. He went for a medical last week, they calculated his BMI and told him he was obese and needed to lose weight!! Totally crazy isn't it.   I agree, BMI can be used as a general measure for most people, however, it really doesn't take into consideration a person's build, athletic build at that.  It doesn't differentiate between between fatty tissue and lean tissue.  5lbs of fat takes up more space than 5lbs of muscle, meaning you can fit more muscle into your body than you can fat.  So your weight is not always a correct interpretation of how much fat is in your body. I think I will just carry on concentrating on increasing my strength and my muscle, replacing my fatty tissue with lean tissue and increasing my fitness and stamina.  However that affects my weight is not so important to me, I will continue to gauge my progress by how many inches I have dropped and how my clothes fit, not get hung up by the scales, as I have said before, they do not define me!! ~BREAKFAST~ I wanted oats this morning, I also wanted pancakes, and I wanted something 'cinnamony' with some maple syrup involved somewhere along the line!! So, I decided on some apple & walnut oaty pancakes with roasted pear and walnuts! So easy, just put 3 tablespoons of oats in a large bowl, I also added 2 teaspoons of chia seeds, then add 2 tablespoons of fat free yogurt and a beaten egg and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, plus a grated apple!  Then just mix together. Heat a non stick pan and drop the 'oat batter' mix into rounds, I made 3, cook for about 4 minutes on each side.  Whilst they are cooking add a chopped pear and some chopped walnuts to the pan too and let them 'roast' in the heat. I then served them up with the pear and walnuts scattered  over the top of the pancakes, a drizzle of maple syrup and a spoonful of fat free greek yogurt. Absolutely amazing! The third one was put aside for my afternoon snack after the gym this afternoon!! ;) ~LUNCH~ No need for a mid-morning snack today, the pancakes saw me right through! So today's lunch was another helping of the delicious chicken, lemon and green vegetable soup I made yesterday.  As there was no blog yesterday here is the recipe:- In a large pan I cooked some spinach, broccoli, asparagus, sugar snap peas and courgettes in some good organic chicken stock.  I then added 2 chopped up chicken breasts and let them poach in the liquid until cooked through.  Seasoned with a good dose of white pepper. I then simply blitzed with a hand held blender, but leaving some bits whole. When serving I grated some fresh parmesan and fresh lemon zest over the top and scattered some roasted pumpkin seeds too. This had such an amazing flavour, and the added lemon zest really brings it alive, I totally love it! ~AFTERNOON SNACK~ After a good swimming session today I fixed myself my favourite berry protein smoothie and heated up the remaining apple oat pancake left over from this morning. ~DINNER~ I love to do a mid-week roast, especially now the nights are drawing in and it has become colder, it makes everything alright with the world! ;) Tonight I did a yummy roast chicken dinner. I simply lift the skin on a chicken and stuff grated lemon zest, garlic and lemon thyme underneath.  I add two lemon halves to the chicken cavity and then place it in a rack in a roasting tin so that as it cooks the fat drips away. I roasted potatoes, sweet potatoes and parsnips in the Actifry without any oil for 45 minutes so that they were lovely and crisp. I then simply lightly boiled some sliced carrots and roman cauliflower, then used the vegetable water and chicken juices (drained off fat) with a little cornflower to make the gravy. Absolutely gorgeous. Incase you were wondering, this is an Actifry... It is a way to 'fry' foods, especially potatoes, with little or no fat.  It rotates and turns the food you place in the cooking bowl continuously and blow continuous hot air over it, making potatoes extremely crisp even without any oil .  I never add oil to my potatoes, I just cook them dry and they are always crisp and fantastic, I don't even par boil them beforehand! I also cook numerous other dishes in mine, it is a brilliant 'gadget'! ~EXERCISE~ A really good swimming session today, the pool was practically empty so I managed a good 100 lengths, and I loved every one.  Rather than running out of energy the more I do, I find myself getting stronger and this really pushes me on.  It is brilliant. I rewarded myself with a good ten minutes in the steam room and a good 20 minutes in the jacuzzi, well deserved I reckon!! Thanks again for reading Jo xxן»¿
new year, new goals: inspired by nikki phillippi! When the new year comes around most people make resolutions, usually focused around dramatic changes that they want in their lives. To eat healthier, to exercise everyday, to lose a certain amount of weight. Last year I decided against making new year's resolutions because I found come February I had forgotten a good chunk of them. This year I was ready to the same, until I was inspired after watching this You-Tube video by Nikki Phillippi.  In the video Nikki talks about separating your goals into categories  and then listing small tangible steps, in other words something small you can do each day to achieve that goal.  Often goals are unrealistic and hence they are not achieved, the method described by Nikki enables you to have small very realistic steps, and because they are realistic expectations upon yourself, it makes it a heck of a lot easier to achieve your end point. After finding inspiration from watching Nikki's video and thinking about my own goals and what I would like to achieve this year, I made my own set of goals following the method described. Travel & Hobbies  I love to travel and discover and experience new places. Last year I only managed one holiday abroad. I really would like to go on  a minimum of two trips abroad, this year.  Last year when I was living on my own I use to read a lot, Since I've been home for the past 5 months I've managed only one book! I really would love to get back into reading as there are so many books I want to read but just haven't got around to! 1) Go on two trips abroad this year Tangible steps:  Spend five minutes a day researching/planning/organising/finalising a holiday  2) Get back into reading Tangible steps: Make a reading list of books I want to read.  Spend two minutes a day reading and work my way through the list.  Relationships Since leaving University and entering the working world a couple of years ago, I feel that I don't keep in contact, and get together as much with my friends as I use to! I guess everyone is busy with their working lives, but I really think it is important to make time to see your friends and this year I really want to make an extra effort to stay in touch and get together on a regular basis. 1) Reconnect with friends Tangible steps: Text one friend everyday Talk to one friend every month on the phone for a good 20-30mins Health & Fitness I think every one of us could say that would like to eat more healthily and do more exercise. It can definitely be grouped into the classic New Year's resolution category. I'm not wanting to lose weight, just eat a more nutritious and balanced diet and exercise in order to feel better and fitter!  1) Eat a healthier diet Tangible Steps: Eat a portion of fruit or vegetable with every meal of the day Eat Breakfast every day  Drink a glass of water with every meal to keep myself hydrated.  2) Get back into exercising Tangible steps:  Take the stairs at work each morning  Put on a YouTube workout video and spend 3 minutes a day working out Financial  I guess I'm not getting any younger, I'm soon to hit 26, and I need to start thinking about the future, getting my own place and settling down etc. The best part of this goal is I've set up a direct debit so I don't even have to physically do anything further. 1) Build up my savings nest - to spend on a car/ deposit on a house Tangible Steps: Set up a Direct Debit for ֲ£250 from my wages to go into a regular savings account each month.  Spiritual  I'm afraid to say i'm definitely more of a glass half empty person than a glass half full person, and i would like to be more positive this year.  1) Reconnect with god Tangible steps:  Spend two minutes a day praying  2) Feel happier and be positive  Tangible steps:  Read one inspirational quote each morning End the day thinking of three good things that happened during the day  To all of you that made it to the end, thank you so much for taking time out of your day to read this post.  If your thinking it's already half way through January, it's too late to set some goals now, then I would say you still have 338 days of the year left, it's not to late! So definitely take some time and think about your goals and see if this method will work for you. Do tell me your resolutions/leave me links in the comments below, because I would love to read them! Today's Inspirational Quote: "Nothing is impossible, the word itself say's I'm possible!" - Audrey Hepburn  Sita xoxo 
Food. I've started eating healthily again. After realising I can do much more with my figure. I've decided to give up on bikinis and focus on flattering swimwear :P I'm not into diets, so take note that this is not a diet, if it infact a lifestyle. I prefer a slower longer-lasting change than an instant flip of lifestyle that I can't maintain. I just know I'm going to look back and think 'Man, I was hot, what was I worrying about!!' hehe. Anyways, peer pressure to keep fit always gets me, but it's good. This is random but I've discovered that cocoa butter could possibly be responsible for darkening my lips, I've recently been using it as lip balm (the skin butter version), and I've noticed brown pigmentation darkening in my brownish/pinkish lips. That's the only place that I've noticed darkening though.. I'm not too bothered about darkening as long as its even, so I'm quite against my darker lips.. grrrr!! Oh yes, these shallow revelations have reminded me of a great read called "Everybody's Free to wear Sunscreen." Check out the Youtube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfq_A8nXMsQ
How I Self Care My Mental Health Self-care is about looking after your mental health in the same way you look after your physical health. Over the past year I’ve really been paying attention to what makes me feel better on days where my mental health is in a bad place and what makes me feel worse. I now try to put the things that make me feel better into practise regularly in the same way somebody might go to the gym three times a week to maintain physical health. I’ve found that by making a conscious effort to self-care I’m helping look after my mental health as best I can. Everybody self-cares differently but today I wanted to share with you some of the things that help me. Switch Off Social Media Being a blogger I find that I’m constantly on social media sharing posts, replying to tweets and interacting with other bloggers. As much as I love doing these things they’re incredibly time consuming. I try to switch off from social media for an hour every day. It’s surprising how much more energy I put into something when I’m not checking Twitter every 5 minutes. I love having an hour to focus on myself or give someone I love my undivided attention. It makes me feel so much more present in my life. Change My Diet I’m far from a healthy eater but when I notice that my mental health is flagging I consciously try to eat better. Food can play a massive role in moods and hormones. I find that drinking caffeinated drinks when I’m anxious can make my anxiety so much worse so I try to cut back on those and switch to water instead. For me it’s about making small, easy, changes that go a long way in improving my mood. Tackle One Small Thing  Although ignoring everything on my to do list is incredibly tempting on bad days I find that I feel better in myself if I accomplish something. I look for the smallest task on my list and do it. It can be something as simple as washing up or watering the plants. I find that doing one small thing makes me feel better about not being able to manage the big things and gives me some much needed confidence.  Take a Bath When I’m feeling depressed it can take a lot of effort to do simple things like maintain personal hygiene but something that always makes me feel better is getting clean and my favourite way to get clean is by having a bath.  I like to really treat myself when I take a bath by using some gorgeous products from Lush. I make it a really luxurious experience. I especially like using products that are going to help me to relax and unwind. Not only do I come out of the bath feeling clean but also rested after having some quiet, pampered, me time.  Watch a Sitcom  If I’m having a hard time with my anxiety I can find it really hard to concentrate which makes it difficult to relax with a book or a movie but I do love to watch sitcoms.  One episode usually only lasts for 20 minutes so I don’t have to concentrate on something for a long period of time and when I’m in that mind frame it feels so good to laugh! If you need some recommendations my favourites are New Girl, Mom, The Office and Friends. Colour Colouring in switches my brain off like nothing else. It’s the only time where I fully lose myself and forget about my problems. I can get lost for hours in a world where only shapes and colour exist and sometimes that’s just what I need if my anxiety is making me overthink things. BuzzFeed  Notice earlier how I said switch off social media and not the internet? That is because I love Buzzfeed! If I’m feeling down I especially love their quizzes, sometimes you just have to know which Starbucks drink you are y’know? They’re fun, silly and pointless and can be a really great distraction. Play With My Dog It’s been scientifically proven that pets reduce stress and anxiety so playing with my dog is a no brainer for me. Spending time with her makes me so happy and it’s an added bonus if we play fetch outside because it’s one of the only times that I’ll actually willingly do some form of exercise and we all know that exercise is great for depression. Get Support I used to struggle with my mental health alone and bottle up my feelings but over the past year I’ve been opening up more and have learned that it’s okay to lean on people and get some support when you need it. Rather than sit alone with my thoughts I’ll talk to my mum, best friend or counsellor about how I’m feeling. Sometimes just the act of opening up and getting stuff off my chest can make me feel better.  Having open and honest conversations is so important to me and goes a long way in making my mental health manageable. These are some of the things I do to self-care my mental health. If you’re not sure where to start with self-care, try keeping a diary of the things that have helped you when you’ve been having a bad time (and of the things that have made you feel worse so you know what to avoid.) Get to know your mental health really well and start working more of the things that help you feel better into your schedule. You can either spread them out over the week or take out one day to have some me time. Looking after your mental health is just as important as looking after your physical health and although self-care doesn’t solve all of life’s problems, knowing what works for you allows you to put strategies in place to help you cope and if that can make those bad days feel a little more bearable, then it’s worth it.  
AFTER DARK Thought I'd post this quickly because it's been long overdue. The people at Dressestylist were kind enough to send me this custom-made number weeks ago. The colour (supposed to be cobalt blue) was not as cobalt-y as I expected but it makes it more demure. Add a modest thigh split and the cute back and it's probably something I'd wear to a wedding or more formal/ sensible event. I figured the rich deep colour of the dress was perfect for a sundown shoot but unfortunately Richard and I left it a bit late and the 'shoot' turned into a 15 minute quick snap in near darkness after the sun went down. Still, did my best to salvage the photos in Photoshop and I think it turned out ok? I'm definitely thinking of re-shooting it more creatively though in the future... As always, comment what you think and defintiely check out Dressestylist if you're on the lookout for well made, cheap and custom-made formal dresses!
Ups and Downs ? Have had an odd week since my last post. All started well on Wednesday and I ate like a pig trying to use all my points.    Weight Watchers has changed and in my opinion for the better.  Fruit is now free and most vegetables so it's all the other stuff that goes with it that you have to point. You are allocated a daily allowance of points that are calculated on you weight, sex, age and height which you have to use each and every day. Non of this carrying over business like there used to be. Then all members have an additional weekly allowance of 49. This can be used on whatever and however you want. I am at the moments splitting it between my days so I have 33 points a day. But if I am going out, or having a meal I can use them towards this instead.  So what have I eaten this week ?? Wed: 04/01 BreakFast - 2 x Turkey Rashers                  Baked Beans                  Slice of Toast  Lunch -       Brown Rice                  Wafer This Ham                   Cucumber and Celery                  no fat strawberry yoghurt Dinner -      Fillet of Salmon                  Broccoli and sweetcorn Snacks -     2 full fat Babybel                 1 curly Wurly Thurs: 05/01 Breakfast -  2 egg omlette with ham Lunch -       2 Weight Watcher (WW) Tortillas with wafer thin ham                  Cucumber, Sweetcorn                  1 red apple Dinner -      4 bacon medallions                   Mushrooms                  A poached egg                  Baked Beans                  1 slice of toast with flora light                  Brown Sauce                  Raspberry Sorbet Snack -       1 full fat Babybel Fri 06/01 Breakfast -  Baked Beans on a slice of Wholemeal toast with flora light Lunch -       Golden Rice                   Wafer Thin Ham                   Philadelphia extra light                  6 x Melba Toast  As some of you know after lunch I was taken to hospital and had the pleasure (not) of an overnight stay. The good thing is it was nothing serious and I am under treatment. The not so good thing was the fact that I had lost my appetite and only ate because I had to. Dinner  - A cheese sandwich with proper butter on white toast and slice of toast with porper butter later on. Sat - 07/01  Breakfast - 2 slices of white toast with proper butter Just before lunch I was discharged and my husband took me home then went shopping with our daughter !!!!! Not as bad as you might think, he was very thoughtful, (as I felt like crap for the next few days) and bought me in some crumpets for breakfast, which he found out are quite low pointed, and some weight watcher meals so I could just stick something in the oven when I was hungry and still keep on track. So how did I do ??   drum roll please ..................................................................................... I lost a fantastic 4lb.  I am so pleased, to say I didn't have an appetite and ate lots of white bread (my vice) that I still lost so much. I am going to set my self little goals instead of a large goal that will seem impossible to meet. My first is losing 5 % of my starting bodyweight. This means I have 5lbs to loose and I am determined to meet this in the next 3 - 4 weeks.  I'm not sure what my finishing weight will be, but I have a particular summer dress I would like to me wearing this year. Will keep you posted xx
Fast Weight Loss - Simple Tips If You Want Weight Loss Fast In numerous ways weight impacts an individual's physical appearance, but no more so than the impact is has upon a person's mental state. This may be the overall quality of life, self-pride, clinical depression, health dangers or personal in capabilities. There are a lot of positive changes once an individual undergoes fast weight loss. It's for this reason that many people are looking for a fast weight loss formula that will certainly cut down those fats and acquire that slim head turning body. But firstly before starting any fast weight loss program the most important thing that you need do is look for a physician to recommend the best weight loss program for you. This program should not be executed until after the doctor has examined fully, your entire physical well being. Then the selection of a suitable weight loss program can commence without fear of over doing it and causing serious health problems. That being said to lose weight fast, 4 aspects of living should be altered: 1. What to consume 2. How to consume 3.Behavior and 4. Activity level. Here are accelerating tips that can alter a person's life who has trouble with weight loss: 1. To achieve weight reduction fast you need to put a formula together that comprises mindset, exercise, and in additional instances, diet supplementations. Commence by finding a diet nutrition plan that can easily be accustomed to you and your lifestyle. Integrate in the formula an exercising plan that allows even at least 15 minutes a day of exercise like lively walking, running, swimming, and dancing. 2. You need to have a determined down-to-earth approach. The power to center and bear proper mindset enables somebody on a diet to promptly drop off those additional pounds. With discipline and suitable mindset, a dieter will never be disheartened and suffer loss of focus with their weight loss efforts. 3. Take heed as the physical structure speaks, never over do anything that may have ill effects. Each and everyone's body's metabolic process responds differently to different fast weight loss programs and plans. Attempt replacing one program for another to counterbalance the body's response. Exercise programs must be appropriate to one's physical structure, some people are not able to exercise as strictly as others. Whenever walking is all that can be done, then walk because this represents  the best exercise for your body. Muscular tissue burns up more calories than fat tissue and so it's likewise better to apply a little muscle, so you might want to add a light weight program to your weight loss program at your local gym. 4. You will need to consume more fiber in your daily food intake as it makes a you full earlier and remains in the tummy longer, retarding the rate of digestion. A individual serving of whole grain bread motions fat through the gastrointestinal system faster. Cereals turn into blood glucose that spikes the body's insulin level therefore, making the body a lot more stimulated, telling the body it needs to stop burning fat. This retards fast weight loss as you want to burn that stored fat that the body has acquired. 5. Keep away from deep-fried foods particularly fried because this carries a heavy amount of fat. Whilst fish and chicken seem leaner than beef, this white meat can absorb more fat when fried than when beef meat is fried. It's advisable for those on severe diets to choose grilled food as this food does not have or contain more fats after the food has been cooked. 6. Drink a lot of water or low joule, low sodium fluid. Drinking at least six to eight glasses of water a day keeps the body refreshed. Since weight loss depends on how the body eliminates body wastes, the body must stay hydrated. All in all, discipline and consistency is still the best practice and the key to a fast weight loss. You need to calculate the right measure of activity and exercise you need and apply it in a even way each day. This will give weight reduction faster than having a massive activeness only to be accompanied a return to old habits. As this will only lead to acquiring more weight than the weight you originally had prior to your dieting commencing. Be consistent and overtime your weight loss will be successful and learn how toget skinny fast.
Settling in It's taken three long months but I think I am finally settling into London life. A HUGE part of that is finally securing a job - unemployment is an enormous factor in happiness when you're in a foreign country without your network of friends and family.  And job hunting in London is so much tougher than it ever was in Sydney.  For a contract role at a Telco I had 3 rounds of interviews, a psych assessment, a case study and a presentation.  Only to be rejected for an internal candidate.  So it's tough, but I have finally secured a contract with a retail bank in the UK and I start next week so I'm totally stoked.  I can honestly say that since securing a job I finally had my first decent night's sleep since March.  I've been slowly making friends and getting out a bit more.  Reformer Pilates has been my saviour whenever I've been frustrated with the work situation.  I've been pretty diligent with my home life - doing laundry, cooking, dishes, cleaning.  I have to admit I did let the eating habits slide a bit.  I was eating out of boredom which resulted in eating 5 meals a day and eating chocolate, pastries, cookies - foods that I never used to eat back at home.  It all came to a head a few weekends ago when I ate so much lunch I almost felt like throwing up.  I decided immediately that I would get back to 3 reasonably healthy/normal sized meals a day and it was surprisingly easier than I expected.  I'm slowly learning the names of the different tube lines and roughly where the main tube stops are.  I've started getting annoyed if I have to wait more than 5 minutes for a bus.  BUT I haven't started complaining about the weather (give it a few more weeks) and I certainly am not used to queueing for everything.  Brits love to queue.  Everywhere.  For anything.  I don't know whether the queueing culture has created a culture of slow service workers or vice versa but it's bloody frustrating.  I had been keeping a shopping list on my phone and I said to myself I would reward myself when I finally got a job (and also because when you're unemployed for 6 months, how do you justify buying all the fancy things?).  Of course my new job confirmation came at the same time as Black Friday and I may have gone a little crazy.  That's another post....  I have a few things planned for my final week of unemployment and if I stop being lazy I will actually blog about it.
Too Blind To See It Verbing...  Look man I love you. I am in love with you but I do have knowledge that everything or in this case everyone ain't for you.  You broke my heart. I thought I was past that but I feel like I just been in mental rehab. Every time you walk back in my life and draw us closer saying everything that I wish my King would say, only to label us the title of being "friends".  The mockery of it all.  Every one says "He's gonna come back again". I say to them "He better not".  It's like you are my favorite dish that has proven to be unhealthy for me unless I substitute a few ingredients with something else.  It's like you don't think about how this push and pull method has an effect on me. I love you... a lot but I want you to STOP. You cannot be my best friend and in love with me too. You are not allowed to slip up and tell me you love me.  It's not fair to my heart!  It hurts!  It's hard to be around you and not have you yet I am too afraid to tell you to go away because I would lose a prayer partner and a great friend.  My temptation...  You are my temptation.  I pray to the Lord to lead me not into temptation.  I cannot deal with this. My mind is boggling with every trivial thing that you do. I need to focus... I need to heal... I need to be with just me.  You want me to need you only when it's convenient to you. You want me to want you but you do not want me to have you. Then, you want me to be perfect and to be perfect yourself.  I cannot live a lie any longer. We are not perfect. We will disappoint and upset each other and we will make each other smile and laugh. Until you realize this a thought of a relationship is worthless. If you never take a chance that's on you.  Just know I tried.  I always kept it real regardless if it meant you would be upset temporarily. As a friend, a best friend should.  One whom loves flows for you so deep she would go to the every part of this world to stay by your side...  as your Queen even if you are too blind to see it.

So I had my weigh in this morning and I managed to lose four pounds!! Weight Last Week - 191.3 Weight This Week - 187.3 I'll be honest and say I don't know how I managed to do that because I haven't been the best in terms of my eating but a loss is a loss and I'll take one when I can get one! I'm also back into the 180's which is a great feeling for me - I'm determined not to let myself creep back into the 190's again!
all shows over for the summer! WOW! Guys & Dolls tonight was fantastic! I had every doubt that we could pull the whole show together within just four days but we actually pulled it off, and the makeup/costumes/hair looked stunning! It was as a lot of the audience approached me with, "A HIT!" I wasn't expecting to be quite as upset as I was that it was over!! It's gone so quickly and the cast were so fantastic, and I went on stage looking just like Madonna, really did feel like a beauty queen (maybe not for our time but back in the day)... (it doesn't look at all like me i'm aware!) I'm a bit down to say that the showbiz for the summer is over for the year! From the Palladium performance all the way to Guys & Dolls, no matter what standard of profession any of the shows were in I have enjoyed every single one of them and I'm so disappointed to go back to the boring 'normal' life for a while. (I also had to turn down an M.I. High for CBBC casting today as I'm on holiday on the recording dates :( !!) I'm off to Greece in a week or so, which should be a lovely break, and I'm really looking forward to resting my voice (unless I enter some daft karaoke competition)! It managed to last for the show, but now it's beginning to sound like it's been run over by a train or something! (Besides the whole buying a new bikini and catch up meals with various friends), I'm now focussing on my GCSE results which arrive next Tuesday. I feel sick in the pit of my stomach every time I think about it. It isn't so much the results I'm worried about, it's whether they allow me into my college course!! Fingers crossed all the way! I also have planned my next recordings in more detail today and I'm aware they should be around September/November peak time. I'm really looking forward to it, and now that I've left school I will have a lot more time on my hands to focus on the technique etc. Other than that, I'm searching for a new showbiz project to take on over Christmas. I do usually do the local Radlett Pantomime. This year I'm aware it's Jack & The Beanstalk. Panto is always so much fun and cheese, but if something bigger comes up then I would prefer to grab that opportunity! Other than that, I'm still hoping to get good snippets of performances on youtube, and anticipating the arrival of my Billy Elliot DVD! Have a lovely rest of the week!!
12.27.2004 Scientific Accuracy   For example, while the Bible was not written as a science textbook, it is in harmony with true science when it deals with scientific matters. But other ancient books regarded as sacred contain scientific myths, inaccuracies and outright falsehoods. Note just four of the many examples of the Bible's scientific accuracy.   How the earth is held in space. In ancient times when the Bible was being written, there was much speculation about how the earth was held in space. Some believed that the earth was supported by four elephants standing on a big sea turtle. Aristotle, a Greek philosopher and scientist of the fourth century B.C.E., taught that the earth could never hang in empty space. Instead, he taught that the heavenly bodies were fixed to the surface of solid, transparent spheres,with each sphere nested within another sphere. Supposedly the earth was on the innermost sphere, and the outermost sphere held the stars.   Yet, rather than reflect the fanciful, unscientific views existing at the time of its writing, the Bible simply stated (in about the year 1473 B.C.E.): "[God is] hanging the earth upon nothing." (Job 26:7) In the original Hebrew, the word for "nothing" used here means "not any thing," and this is the only time it occurs in the Bible. The picture it presents of an earth surrounded by empty space is recognized by scholars as a remarkable vision for its time. The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament says: "Job 26:7 strikingly pictures the then known world as suspended in space, thereby anticipating future scientific discovery."   The Bible's accurate statement predated Aristotle by over 1,100 years. Yet, Aristotle's views continued to be taught as fact for some 2,000 years after his death! Finally, in 1687 C.E., Sir Isaac Newton published his findings that the earth was held in space relation to other heavenly objects by mutual attraction, that is, gravity. But that was close to 3,200 years after the Bible had stated with elegant simplicity that the earth is hanging "upon nothing."   Yes, nearly 3,500 years ago, the Bible correctly noted that the earth has no visible support, a fact that is in harmony with the more recently understood laws of gravity and motion. " How Job knew the truth," said one scholar, 'is a question not easily solved by those who deny the inspiration of Holy Scripture."   Continued - Next time: The Shape Of The Earth 
Emotional Eating……….  I am a very emotional person AND an emotional eater. Well that explains the 30 lbs I need to loose!  You know even JUST 25 would also be OK by me…..  This weekend after my race I came home to some really sad news. My brother in law who was treated for stage 1 lung cancer last year had a bad routine follow up scan this week. Apparently there is some stage 4 cancer in one of his ribs. I am beyond sad.  My sister met her husband probably when I was about 10 or 11.  They married a couple years later, so he has been a part of my life for a very long time.  I love him as a brother.  I was mad, sad……just in a funk after I found out as he has been the rock of our family during many hard times over the years.   I had been eating very well last week and though I know better than to get on the scale every day, I knew I was down 3 lbs before Saturday.  NOW I will say, after that race I found the free Cold Stone Ice cream and totally enjoyed it….that emotion was pure joy of finishing the race strong.  The rest of the weekend I didn’t feel like eating so I kind of ate junky…..not a ton, just didn’t juice and ate processed crap….yeah, its crap, my body doesn’t need it. My husband is wonderful, yesterday he saw the funk I was in and said “Let’s go out and use that gift card so you don’t have to cook dinner”. We went to Nava, his favorite place. They put out these blue corn bread rolls which are HEAVEN and yeah, I ate way too many of those.  Felt good going in though – which see that is my problem.  Got on the scale this morning and “only” down 1/2 pound. I will say so far today has been good, but when making our meatloaf tonight, I started shoving in saltines….. I know, could be worse, but again, I don’t want processed white stuff……  SIGH.  I need to pull it together. The GOOD news is despite the saltines otherwise today has been great….. juice for breakfast – Apple, Pear, Strawberry, Blueberry, Kale, Spinach and Coconut Water – I love how I just can use up the fruit I need to like the berries this morning.  Man I love that mix, SO good.  I ate some carrots for snack at preschool and then on the way home I stopped at Dunkin Donuts for Coffee – cream no sugar…I was hungry so I got an egg and cheese wrap for 99c along with an unsweet Iced Coffee…..hey the wrap is better than eating a donut, even though its American “cheese”.  Juiced up later with my favorite veggie drink “Green Lemonade” – Cucumber, Celery, Apple, Spinach, Kale and Lemon.  Talk about fresh – its super good. I am making Meatloaf for dinner with veggies and salad…so for the day I am happy.  Please pray for my brother in law if you are a prayerful person.  He went to the radiologist today for course of action.  Also include my sister and her adult kids.  I really hate they are going through this.  Thanks….and for me any advice on how to get through emotional eating is always welcome!
Carbs It's interesting to see that I have adapted pretty well to a low carb diet. But when the day goes badly and stress levels rise, the need, or craving rather, for carbs is at times unbearable.  Driving home with the kids, for a fleeting moment all I wanted was wine and chocolate. So I bought apples and tried to calm down.  Doug got home and we could have gone for a filthy dominos combo, but we held firm and I ate Paleo chilli with loads of salad.  The minimal damage done by my mud working week blip was a bag of popcorn and two Becks blue. A few too many carbs for weight loss I suppose, but so much better than a bottld of wine and lashings of chocolate.  See self, you can be strong!
An Update and Apologies for the Absence... I have just stumbled across an unmoderated comment from Karen which asks if married life is now so hectic that I do not have time to post. Well, first, Karen, please accept my apologies for not responding, but my Yahoo! mail account, where I receive these alerts, will sometimes work and allow me to see my messages, and other times, it just cannot be bothered and tells me it 'appears to be having a problem loading this message'. I think it may be menopausal to be honest...One type of message it never fails to deliver is an offer to extend my penis. Since I still can't find my penis, despite years of looking, maybe this is a valid suggestion? Is married life hectic? I guess attempting to get Mr Parsnip's breakfast right in the morning has become a bit of an ordeal...there's not enough golden syrup on his porridge; I have used sugar instead of golden syrup; the dried fruits aren't sweet enough and thus he needs sugar; he doesn't want mackerel...I have since gone on strike and told him he makes his own from now on. You can only kick a dog so many times before it turns and bites you on the bum. (Caveat: he has been so sweet recently, he got an omelette this morning...) But, it's not so much married life which is hectic, it's being a full-time mother (as well as a full-time whipping boy to my boss, The Fat Controller) to a full-time teenager which is now starting to take its toll.  #1 has become the nightmare daughter. Not only does she do the usual things such as slamming doors, leaving dirty clothes everywhere, turning her bedroom into a filth magnet and decreasing the temperature of the room to sub-zero with her glares, she has now been in detention for kissing her boyfriend (a callow, spotty youth with a mono-syllabic vocabulary), flirts remorselessly with any male of her age, uses her dinner money for chewing gum or chocolate and La Senza underwear (which even I struggle to afford from time to time, hence my George at Asda (Walmart for our US reader) knickers) and lies through her back teeth to me. Fortunately, I am blessed with one of the most suspicious minds known to man: I trust nary a soul, and can smell a set-up a mile off. You have to get up jolly early in the morning to get one over on me, and since I rise with the birds, you're not likely to get a lot of sleep in your endeavours...  After yet another saga last night which has resulted in two weeks' grounding, a ban from parties/sleepovers/breathing, a ban on the use of the house phone, and confiscation of her mobile once I can find the damned thing, and the application for Boarding School prospectuses, I remarked to Mr Parsnip that I was bewildered at how I could beg, plead, cajole, encourage, or threaten the same things over and over again, only to be ignored repeatedly. I was staring at the kettle at the time. "Look at that kettle. You ask it to boil. It says, OK, and Bob's your uncle. One pot of boiling water. Simple isn't it? Why can't she be as compliant?"  Mr P, for some odd reason, found this hilariously funny, and shook with laughter so much that he nearly fell off his perch on the kitchen worktop.  She has started to go through my wardrobe and shoes racks (of which there are many, I must confess) and asks if, when I die, she can have X, Y or Z pair of shoes. There are then the 'dumb blonde' questions (she is blonde by nature, but has enhanced with a dodgy dye I did for her last year) such as, 'Mum, if I put on three different deoderants, each with 24-hour protection, does that mean I don't have to wash for three days?'...The mind boggles...  #1 and I are now of similar dress sizes. It is not that she has put on weight, it is just that the weight has fallen off me with worry. (For our American reader, I weigh in at a size 4 and look like Cruella de Ville). She hates me for it, berates me for it, and tells me that I ought to be like all the other Mums. Her friends' mothers are all on the very short side (unlike me); bleached blonde (unlike me); work part-time or not at all (unlike me) and have the propensity to enjoy the occasional pie or double fish and chips. I am deemed 'un-Mumsy'. She still likes to nick my Karen Millen dresses, though... She has her moments, though - such as when she wants to go horse riding, she will do all the family's ironing, as long as she gets in that car. She will also 'baby-sit' her 11-year old sister for unlimited use of the house phone to call her spotty boyfriend and she can make a mean lasagne. When I am reincarnated, I will not return as a Mother. I will return as a hedgehog. They have fun...
The First Time Is Always Awkward   First kiss. First page in a brand new notebook. First blog post. They are all awkward and leave you wondering "um, what am I supposed to do now?"  I hate firsts in general, but especially the ones where I have to put my vulnerable self out there for everyone to criticize me (dramatic much!!). I had this grand plan for how to launch this blog. A fancy YouTube video. A long academic-looking article. The works!! But I realized that just wasn't me. And if you've followed me on YouTube or Instagram, then you KNOW that isn't me.  I don't care about the fancy, super pretty, or overly done up. I want things to work and I want to work to get things done. Most importantly, I want to do things that bring me joy and make me happy. Helping others be more productive definitely makes me happy. Fancy editing and flawless blog posts. Not so much.  So I just threw this out there. My blog is currently being hosted on free Blogger with nothing more than a $9 investment in my custom domain name. Once I have the social proof that I am truly helping others be more productive, then I'll worry about all the other stuff.  My first post is being written at almost midnight two days before my blog goes live to the world. I have a pounding migraine and have dozed off twice while writing this short post. But this is real life yall. And I wouldn't have it any other way.  Until next time,  Antonisha La'Shay
Holiday Time! I just realized it's been too long since I've posted here.  But I didn't want to pass up the chance to post on 12-12-12, the last symmetrical date we will ever see in our lifetimes!  And it's happening right in the thick of holiday time, with Hanukkah underway, Christmas very close, and the end of the year within sight as well.   I absolutely love Christmastime.  And though I haven't been as diligent about my exercising as I would like, at least I have not abandoned it altogether.  If I can even go to the gym once a week between now and the end of Christmastime (in our house, January 6 is the last day of Christmastime), I'll consider it a success.  Though I haven't really lost any weight since we got back from Ireland in early November, I also haven't gained any - I'll take that, thank you very much.  I know for a lot of people, the time between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day is when they lose their motivation, time, and desire to remember to stay healthy.  It's so easy to do, since even if you don't go crazy with parties and celebrations, there's usually something on your calendar that keeps you running around.  I'm doing better this year than I have for quite a few years, and it's actually making me more thoughtful about eating and exercising.  I grab some steps whenever I can at work, and on days when the weather cooperates, I try to walk around the block at least during lunchtime, or take the slightly longer route walking home.  I haven't made myself give up any goodies, but I try to not eat as much and/or have a smaller meal next time.  I enjoy this time of year too much to become a martyr.  And tomorrow, I have my annual mammogram.  I don't look forward to it, but I know it's necessary, and have been fortunate to have been able to avoid even more drastic measures down the road since my cancer was caught early.  Every year, I think my luck is gonna be up again, but so far I've had a good report each time.  Hopefully tomorrow will be the same result.  In the meantime, I'll be right here, enjoying myself.  Why don't you do the same???
HOW I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢M GOING TO BALANCE BLOGGING AND A-LEVELS.  The direction of where this blog is going has been playing on my mind for a couple of months now and I think it׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s time to reveal what my plans is for Hideaway Girl. As you may or not know, I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢ve just started sixth form at a new place where I hardly know anyone which in the next free weeks is going to be a challenge for me. It׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s one of the most successful public sixth forms in the country and so, it means there will be a lot of work like all A-Levels. However, I still want to blog and talk to you guys about my normal ongoings and what I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢m up to.  But my life is going to be mostly studying.  Which weirdly, I love. So, it׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s come to my decision to start making study/academic blog posts but of course, still have my blog posts about life in general. In my spare time, I always watch study with me(s) and things like that. It׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s really geeky but I have seen other people like my study with me I have done so far. This is what I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢m going to be doing.  I know some people will be worried that I won׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t talk about other things and topics but I will be! But when I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢m studying, it׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s so much easier for me to write study with me blog posts and I enjoy writing them. (It makes me feel more productive)  So, it׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s time for me to start writing things I enjoy writing about and not caring what other׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s want also.  Astrid X
50 days after my 0p :) So here it is, the big updateג€¦ its been 50 days since my op :O which is a shock as it feels like it was only a few days ago but its been a good few weeks indeed. well what can i say I've slowly worked onto normal food now, I'm basically on normal food with a few limitations like, no steak, no hard foods, and a few beware foods that are good for you but have some sort of chemical or something in them so they can give my stomach a few problems ג€¦ like celery (which is good as i hate it and my mum always puts it in with a salad so it give me an excuse to pick it out)  But other than that its nice not to have to live on small amounts of soup, you don't realize how much you want food like chewy food till you are on a soup diet :( that was hard. Things have got easier as time has gone on but i have to say the depression that i suffered with way before my op, i have days where I'm in suck a sad low mood, i fear that its come back or on its way. where they cut my stomach away this also stops some of the natural vitamins that come from your body to process, this could also be a reason why i can sometimes feel low, i need to make sure I'm having a high protein and vegetables in my diet which i think I'm also slacking. i could defiantly consume more better foods.   Once thing i want to make clear though is that the hunger is still in my head! if your thinking about having this op don't think that it will cut of that signal to the brain and say you are full as it doesn't or not for me anyway. i can eat only a small amount (ruffly about a 2 years portion) and i can tell when my stomach can't handle anymore as you get that same feeling to anyone else that you feel uncomfortable but in my head its saying you can eat more where its used to eating a lot, lot more so i always feel like I'm full to the top as my brain has a habit of over riding my stomach, which yes you guessed it can lead with a massive sick moment, and a very sad Sam hugging the toilet bowl.   Good things, very small list but there is a few. i have lost a little bit of weight which as given me a little bit of confidence back. Allowing me to go to the gym, which the pre-op me would never even dare to go anywhere near anyone in those tight exercising outfits and low i try and do 3 trips to the gym a week where i do a hour in the gym and then a hour in the swimming pool. The other thing is that now i have had the op i know i can't eat a lot so it gives me a chance to just concentrate on the rest of my life because food did used to take over my life, i would be waiting for the next meal or eating what i could just to keep me full, which normally meant a lot of chocolate or crisps that i could eat quickly, which is a good thing now, i no longer have a sweet tooth, i will quite happily eat something savory so ye I'm free from my addiction of food :)  looks, I've been told i do look different, i have noticed that in places where i was biggest it has gone soft where my stomach used to be quite hard, like i always looked blotted now its more of a jelly consistency with skin?? lol so its an interaction that its slowly going. i just thought it would to a lot quicker than this though. i lost my first stone after my op very quickly, most likely where i was only on liquids but now i find that its slowed down and i weigh myself every week and I've lost 1-2 pound which can be quite hard. i just want it to all go and i can feel normal, i just thought it would fall of me a lot quicker than it has. but I've gone from 24 stone + to being 21.3 so I've done well (i did a liver shrinking diet before the op and lost a stone) so ye not bad :) going from a size 26 in clothes to a size 24  ruffly ... i think, even just loosing this amount though has meant that i could go shopping in normal shops, ( i didn't have to go all out and go to a big persons shop) like primark were it was touch and go whether i could find something that fit in the men's department and now i can buy a few bits in the girls department now :)   My next goal is to become more active. before my op when i was at my worst i was very low and i stopped all my clubs and kinda cut my self off from my close friends leaving me alone and at the time that's what i wanted, now i feel low as i don't have a lot of friends to talk too, if you have this op done you will need the support of friends and family around you to help keep you happy. Where your going throw a massive change, its easy to get your self very low along with it :) keep motivated, with your eye on the price and it will eventually come to you :)
My Week 8 Mini Milestone: what it is Hi :)  I said I'd write on Tuesday night...I don't have anything to report, but I thought I'd drop by and talk about my Week 8 Mini Milestone...I'll be completing it tomorrow :) We're actually in Week 9 right now but I couldn't complete this task before Sunday because of a few things, I was interstate and also needed to get my bike fixed. Because...my Mini Milestone is to ride my bike outside, in public.  I haven't ridden it since that day in late 2010 when I came 7000th (see my previous post). I know, it's not a big deal what happened that day and I did feel amazing afterwards, but...it absolutely wrecked my confidence with riding and I haven't sat on it since.  The other reason is because I have put on so much weight since then (maybe 20kg?) that I am afraid to ride in public because I will look so fat, and also I very honestly don't know if my bike can handle my weight.  Also I physically struggled to ride when I was 20kg less...I can't imagine how much it would hurt to do it now. So that whole paragraph that I just wrote...do you know what that was?  That was a paragraph full of excuses.  Every single one of them.  Yes it is all real...but I should have knocked those excuses on their heads and JFDoneI.  Anyway - there's no point in regressing too much ;) The fact is, I have been delaying the inevitable for coming up to 2 years now, and decided to make it my Mini Milestone.  This is a huge thing for me.  I seriously haven't even SAT on my bike since.  I know this, because when I went to do my milestone last week, I realised that the tyres were down and had been down since I swapped tyres after that ride.  I'm not very cycle-technologically advanced and couldn't pump them up, and there were a few other issues so I wiped off the dust (literally), loaded it in my car (see picture!) and took it to a bike shop for a tune up last week.  I pick it up tomorrow.  I'm home from my weekend trip, I'll have a clean, fixed bike, it's Week 8 (9) and I promised myself that I would do this. I'll let you know how I go when I ride tomorrow night.  I've worked myself up for 2 years for this day.  I can do it :)
I didn't want to go Yesterday I started back going to the gym at 5:30 am.  Yeah.  I did 20 minutes on the treadmill (which felt more like 2 hours).  I produced a grand amount of sweat and I was tired after. But I went.  Before I went, I had thoughts of, "How did I let myself get so bad again?"  "People are going to see me."  "People are going to judge me."  "People will laugh, even if it's just to themselves, at me." But despite the fact that I was terrified,  I stepped foot in there.  I did what I could do.  I left feeling proud of myself for going.  For starting. Today I went back again and tried to find a million excuses for going, and once I go there, tried to find a million excuses I should leave early.  But I got my 20 minutes in.  And I'm confident that tomorrow I can increase that to 25. So I'm going to do my best.  I may not like it every day, but I'll do my be
My Mission  Stressed but blessed  Under a mountain of work  Trying to dig myself out  Trying to find the end  Somehow forgetting  That this is my mission  This is my purpose  Every little project  Building into a greater plan  Sometimes it doesn't  Feel like that  But I have to remember  That I don't look at things  The way God does  And every little project  Every letter I write Is building on something  Bigger then I can see  Sorry this is so late, the internet here has been terrible.  
Stephanie lost 52 pounds  Transformation of the Day: Stephanie lost 52 pounds. She learned how to fight emotional eating, stress eating, and binge eating. Cutting out junk food, using at-home workout programs and going vegan has produced excellent results of this mom.  Stephanie before and after  I started gaining weight after I had my oldest son. Emotional eating, stress eating, and boredom eating were the main causes of my weight gain. I went from 165 pounds to 214 pounds.  In 2014, I was my heaviest at 214 pounds. For two years after that, my weight would yo-yo up and down. It took until 2016 for me to get it right. By working out at home, using portion control, and learning to eat right, I was able to lose the weight and keep it off. I have been able to lose a total of 52 pounds.  What was your motivation? What kept you going when you wanted to give up? My motivation was my kids. When I wanted to give up, I thought about how important it was to keep my health up for them.  How did you change your eating habits? The first thing I did was understand the reasons behind my weight gain, which were stress eating, boredom eating, and emotional eating. I cut out junk food, such as cookies, chips, and candy that I was binge eating with. I learned how to make better food choices and how to meal prep by using Beachbody programs. Lastly, I went from an unhealthy vegetarian to a vegan.  Tell us about your workout routine. I worked out at home 6 to 7 days a week using Beachbody programs and became a Beachbody coach. My very first program was P90X.  Stephanie before and after  What is your height? 5׳’ג‚¬ג„¢6׳’ג‚¬ֲ³  How long did your transformation take? I started my journey in 2014 and got serious in 2016. So far, it׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s been a five-year transformation, and I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢m still going.  What is the biggest lesson you׳’ג‚¬ג„¢ve learned so far? The biggest lesson I learned was to not binge out on junk when I got bored or stressed.  What advice would you share with people who want to lose weight? The best advice I could give is for other people is to understand WHY you want or need to lose weight and make that your motivation.
Can new weight loss drugs rival Xenical Recently, the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), approved two new weight loss medications (Belviq and Qysmia), and America breathed a sigh of relief. While weight loss drugs have always been a topic of controversy, over the years it has become clear that their addition to the dieting efforts of many individuals, who struggle with obesity, is extremely beneficial. And with more than one third of Americans (35.7%) falling under the obese category, it is no surprise that medical alternatives to diet and exercise, are needed to counteract the issue. New obesity treatments are needed to bridge the gap between diet and exercise and the more radical option of bariatric surgery. This is a view backed up by Dr Sue DeCotiis, New York City based Medical Internist and Weight Loss Management Specialist, who said, “While there are potential side effects with every medication, long term studies show that overweight patients do much better losing and keeping off weight, when they are prescribed a weight loss drug.” “Weight loss medications work in conjunction with healthy eating and exercise, and offer individuals a chance at a real lifestyle change. Those who suffer from obesity often have a host of other health problems that come with the condition. These drugs can alleviate those symptoms, and the result is that many of these patients will live longer and avoid the consequences of medical problems, such as hypertension, stroke, and heart attack.” Listed below is a description of current weight loss drugs and how they work. Previously the only option was Xenical, but now for the first time in 13 years, Doctors will have a choice of which weight loss drugs to prescribe to overweight or obese patients. Belviq (Locaserin) Approved by the FDA in late June of this year, this medication works by activating a receptor in the brain that helps a person to eat less and still feel full. By regulating the appetite, it lowers the likelihood of individuals overeating. It works best in patients who suffer from weight related conditions, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol. At least 47.5% of patients lost at least 5% of their body weight from the medication, as opposed to 20.3% who took a placebo during a trial study period. Qsymia (Phentermine & Topirmate) This combination of the drugs Phentermine (an appetite suppressant and stimulant) and Topirmate (an anticonvulsant with weight loss side effects) is the most recent of the crop of weight loss medications, that have been approved by the FDA. Drugs in this category are primarily considered appetite suppressants. With the medication producing dramatic weight loss in patients, this is one of the clearest signs of hope for those suffering from obesity related diseases. About half of the patients lost 10% of their body weight and four-fifths lost 5%. Contrave (Bupropion & Naltrexone) This drug that is still to be approved by the FDA, works by combining two active ingredients that have been used for over twenty years. With Bupropion initiating the weight loss, Naltrexone sustains it by preventing the body’s natural tendency to counteract efforts, to lose weight. The result of this combination is to reduce appetite and increase the body’s metabolism, giving those who are suffering from obesity related illnesses the ability to sustain continued weight loss, by addressing the portion of the brain that controls food cravings. Xenical (Orlistat) Xenical, which is the most established and proven of the weight loss drugs, is a lipase inhibitor. Xenical does not enter the patient’s blood stream, but works in the digestive system in the small intestine as a fat absorber. It blocks out a third of the fat in food eaten in a patient’s diet, leading to steady weight loss. Research involving 11,131 woman and 4,418 men, who had been over weight for an average of 14 years, showed that 87% lost at least 5% of total body weight, half lost at least 10%, around 20% lost more than 15% body weight and some patients lost more than 25%. Only time will tell which of these weight loss drugs is the most successful. Unfortunately here in the UK Belviq is not expected to be released until 2013 and there has been no UK release date as yet for Qsymia and Contrave. However all is not lost as here in the UK we still have Xenical available, which has a proven track record for assisting weight loss. Here at Medical Specialists Pharmacy we can dispense Xenical after an online consultation with one of our doctors and as soon as these other weight loss drugs become available, we will be offering them.

Like a fish out of water ג€“ but like a grizzly bear in it I love swimming. I love the feeling of being light weight, lifted off my feet and floating.  I find the repeated rythms relaxing and drift off in my own mind.  Apart from the fact I canג€™t put my head under the water and can really only do the breast stroke, there really arenג€™t any negatives.  I even enjoy it so much that I donג€™t notice if anyone is staring at my beach whale body. Image credit: http://www.mybigfatblog.co.uk/ But, does swimming have an effect on weightloss? Iג€™ve read so many conflicting opinions online recently ג€“ some saying, yes of course, why wouldnג€™t you lose weight as you burn calories, through to the more ridiculous ג€˜youג€™re in cold water and your body holds onto fat to keep you warm.ג€™ What do you all think? Personally I would say, go for it. In addition to strength training and other cardio exercises, swimming can help tone the body and increase lung strength etc. So thereג€™s nothing to lose!
Acidity, Hormones and Weight loss For many women, weight loss can be challenging and although it is common knowledge to eat less and exercise more, what do you do when this formula simply doesn’t work? Leading Australian naturopath Narelle Stegehuis understands the importance of getting to the cause.  "It’s important to remember that although the elements of this traditional weight loss formula are justified, many others such as acidosis and hormonal factors are often overlooked", say's Narelle. With the typical western diet high in animal proteins and processed foods, acidosis is not uncommon, and imbalance in your bodies pH can lead to a range of unpleasant symptoms including stubborn abdominal fat. Acidosis or heightened acidity can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, aches and pains, bloating, digestive problems, hot flashes and mood changes. It has also been associated with health conditions such as Poly Cystic Ovarian Disorder, endometriosis, thyroid imbalance and unexplained infertility.  What Causes Acidity? Acidity is primarily caused by the breakdown of food. When foods such as those mentioned above are broken down, they raise the pH in our body slightly, creating acidity, while whole foods, fruits and vegetables create alkalinity. For many this unfortunately means that our diet has become 30 times more acidic.1,2 This is because 100 years ago, a typical diet contained more vegetables and fibre but less processed foods and soft drinks. This means the ratio of potassium to sodium has changed from 10:1 back then to 1:3 now.  Top 5 Acidity Triggers • Poor diet and excessive anaerobic exercise • Excessive dieting and fasting • Inflammation • Health conditions such as PCOS, Diabetes or endometriosis • Stress  The Impact of Acidity Over acidity has many impacts upon the body, due to its influence on the cell. Firstly, under healthy conditions, the nucleus (centre) of the cell is slightly acidic but the surrounding area is alkaline. This difference in pH creates an electrical current which allows nutrients to pass into the cell nucleus and toxins to be pumped out of it. However, if there is little or no difference in acidity between cell nucleus and environment, there will be a reduced electrical current between the two and consequently less influx of nutrients and less elimination of toxins. This affects your cell’s metabolism. Let’s have a look at the various areas it can impact on. What are the effects of acidity on: • Stress hormones An increase in acidity increases production of the stress hormone cortisol in your adrenals2,3,5. Cortisol activates the production of inflammatory hormones such as Interferon gamma, leading to a state of (chronic) low grade inflammation symptomatic of unexplained aches and pains or fatigue.2 Inflammation puts your body in an energy-storing rather than energy-expending mode, making it easier to put on weight and harder to lose it. Acidosis induced cortisol excess also influences tryptophan (a naturally produced mood enhancing protein). This potentially contributes to lower moods or depression.2 • Glucose metabolism Chronically high levels of cortisol reduce insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by the cells, and increase fatty tissue around the stomach.2,5,6,7,8 This can make conditions such as Poly Cystic Ovarian Disorder, or other hormonal imbalances worse. • Leptin Leptin is a hormone that regulates your satiety. The lower the leptin levels are, the hungrier you feel. Acidosis reduces leptin concentration through a negative link with cortisol: the higher the cortisol levels, the lower the leptin levels. Studies have shown that a diet high in protein (acidic) is associated with significantly lower leptin levels than a diet high in fruit and vegetables (alkalizing).2 • Energy production Acidity blocks energy production in the little powerhouses in your cell nucleus called mitochondria.2 This impairs on the influx of nutrients into the cells slowing your metabolism. • Thyroid hormones Chronic acidity decreases T3 and T4 levels but significantly increases TSH levels. This can cause mild hypothyroidism.3,4,5 • Bone health Acidosis draws calcium from your bones, because calcium is alkalizing. If the pH in your blood increases due to an acidic diet, your body will mobilize calcium from the stores in your bones to alkalize it to reduce its harmful potential. It is your body’s way of trying to maintain equilibrium no matter what cost. This not only leads to an increased risk of osteoporosis as calcium is drawn out of the blood, but also to a higher risk on calcium deposits in the kidneys and gall bladder.3,5  How does this affect your weight? 1. Causes hormonal imbalance Increased levels of insulin, combined with elevated levels of cortisol, put your body in an energy saving mode. This slows down your metabolism and encourages your body to store fatty tissue, especially, but not exclusively, around the tummy area. Ironically, this fatty tissue is not just dead storage, but starts to act as a gland itself and secretes even more cortisol, insulin and inflammatory mediators. This perpetuates the cycle of unexplained weight gain. 2. Slows Your Metabolism Your thyroid regulates your metabolism. Acidosis can trigger low thyroid function and a slow metabolism, once again putting you in energy-saving rather than energy-expending mode. Elevated cortisol levels further impact on this, because they do impair the conversion of (largely inactive) thyroid hormone T4 into the (more active) T3. This means there are less active thyroid hormones available for your body to use, slowing your metabolism even further. 3. Increases Cravings and Appetite With low leptin levels you feel hungry more often, so it is likely that your energy intake through food will be higher. Often you’ll be tempted to choose energy dense foods such as sweets, chocolate, biscuits, or a soft drink to give you that quick boost of energy. Unfortunately, when your body is acidic, your body has no option but to store it for future use: as body fat!  What can you do about this? For many women, restoring balance is the first step to feeling great and getting on top of their health. It also means they can manage chronic illness or unexplained infertility more effectively as in the case of Michelle Curmi from Melbourne Australia. Once Michelle discovered the cause of her imbalance she fell pregnant after years of trying with PCOS and endometriosis. You can read Michelle's story at http://www.massattack.com.au/successMichelle.html Regular exercising and relaxing help reduce acidity in your body, however the most obvious step is to change your diet. Include more alkalizing fruits and vegetables, and reduce the intake of acidic grains, meats, sugars and soft drinks. It is also important to adjust your diet to balance your hormones, especially if acidosis has created imbalances. Alkalizing combinations containing magnesium, potassium or calcium can help improve the acid-alkaline balance, although they should be used with the guidance of a practitioner. Remember, your body may need support to recover from the impact of all this acidity. Although it has an amazing capacity to correct itself, sometimes it needs a helping hand. Medicinal herbs and nutritional support to switch your metabolism from energy-saving to energy-expending mode and gently support natural hormonal balance are also recommended.  How can you measure if you are acidic? If you are concerned about your pH levels, or simply want to monitor them to ensure you do remain within the optimal ranges, you can check this yourself. There is an easy test that you can do at home, to test the pH of urine or saliva, but other body fluids can also be tested. The kit contains a booklet that lists the ideal pH range of various body fluids. If you are interested in this test kit, or want to talk to one of our practitioners about acidity and what we can do to help you, please contact our clinic on 1300 133 536.

Carmen Sandiego [Etsy listing]  https://www.etsy.com/listing/293193949/carmen-sandiego-cross-stitch-pdf  Where in America's Past was the 5th game in the Carmen Sandiego series.  Released in 1991 by Broderbund, it gave blew the other Carmen games out of the water.  Other games were known to have a vague "sketch" graphic of locations.  Those ones that were broken up into four parts, and a typewriter gave you your mission?  Then it showed that mid-80s pixilation of a plane slowly moving across the screen?  You knew it was the Sphinx or the Statue of Liberty but it wasn't really that exciting.  This game showed professional photographs of locations next to pixelated characters.    This game also surpassed Where in Time, by upping its historical facts.  The player had to look up facts for Where in Time, but for Where in America's Past, over 400 years of American history were programed into the game.  Along with 45 geographical areas and 9 historical eras.  One of the biggest compliments was that the colors are more vivid in this game than past games.  Given that, there were mixed reviews, some said it was a great educational game while others said adults and older kids would find it boring.  
The Filth I'm not the most motivated person. I've been this way most my life and because of it I've been called lazy, which isn't exactly wrong. So I'm kinda lazy. You can imagine this mostly applies to cleaning, school, anything I don't particularly enjoy.  Like when I'm drinking water in my room. Instead of getting up and throwing the water bottle away in the kitchen (I don't have a trash can in my room) I simply throw it on the floor and I've accepted this way of living. I've acceptable that pile of water bottles and crumpled pieces of paper five feet away from my bed. Everything builds up. The dirty clothes, the trash, the shoes that I always lose because I just throw them to the side when I get home. I'm a little filthy and I usually have no motivation to fix that. Usually.  There eventually comes a time when the water bottles become too much. The dirty clothes becoming a carpet on the floor is a little suffocating and I have nothing to wear. The random junk I have no need for and old notes I took from church are an eyesore, because now I can actually pinpoint what each pile of garbage is, but then there are the pads and tampons literally everywhere. How they wind up in every corner and crevice of the room, I have no idea.  I look at it and think, “This is fine.” but deep down, I know it's driving me a little mad. Then comes the point where I just have to clean, but it's not like I huff and get to work. It happens progressively, as if my mind is trying with all it's might to get me to do something about the mess and it can finally nudge me forward. It comes with the slow realization that the reason I migrated towards my bed to write is less about comfort and more to do with the fact that my desk is too messy to function. It's less my place to write and more my cat's place to puke when she eats too much. It happens when I begin to realize that the moment I get out of bed, my feet are coated in dirt and I have to constantly wipe them on random pieces of clothing on the floor throughout the day. I get that small nudge when I start to trip over clothes and the mess that is my room starts to come into the clean path from my bed to the door. I get a little bit of motivation when the filth is too much for even me.  Here's where my brain likes to trick me into to cleaning my room. I start with one thing. I think about how great it was when I still used to my desk to write and I think, “I should probably clean it up, it won't take too long.” Then I clean around my chair and under the desk, I pick up the clothes, but I have no place to put them. They're dirty, I can't put them in the basket with my clean clothes.  Side note, I have three baskets for this purpose, but the two other ones are already filled.  I need to clean them so I can put them somewhere, but my parents have gone to bed and the washing machine is right by their door. I decided to on putting them in garbage bags and washing them in the morning. I clean around the desk, but before I know it, I picked up . . . all? . . . the clothes?? Somehow I made it all the way over to the other side of the room and now my dirty clothes are together and ready to be washed??? How did this happen????  Then I suddenly have another bag I'm putting my trash into and the water bottles have been thrown away. My room is looking like a room and I can't stop there. The trash has been thrown away, the clothes off the floor, the feminine products are in unused makeup bags, and my sister is claiming things I don't want and I'm sweeping the remaining things into a pile in the middle of the room and I'm sorting things. I managed to clean off the bookshelf of my older sister's old things and my books have a place to go.  That's how it works. I start with one thing and that puts me in a cleaning mood. I got the motivation not because my parents told me to, but because I chose to do it and I had my own purpose.  I'm now in a clean room that doesn't even look like mine, but I'm reminded of one of the reasons cleaning my room after it becomes that mess bothers me so much. I swept up the floor, moved things around, and the dust and dirt and cat hair becomes unsettled. It's all flying the in air and as I'm finishing up, I'm also sneezing and dying.  By the way, if you're curious, here's a picture of everything I'm allergic to:  (I thought I had avoided food allergies, but it caught me with citric acid.)  I attempt to take allergy medicine, but it's in that moment when my allergies are the worst that I can't find it and my sneezes and sniffles are only getting worse. It's not the “Oh, a little bit of saliva is on my hand, better wipe it off.” sneeze, it's the nasty one. Anyone with allergies knows what I'm talking about.  I'm sitting here in my sparkly clean room and I'm dying. I've learned something today about messy rooms and letting it all build up.  Cleaning it up causes death. Just don't worry about it. Be filthy. It's fine.
I've actually done something creative!! Well I'm beginning to feel a bit more comfortable in my new job but am still totally exhausted every day!  Mentally exhausted from trying to remember everything. Because of this I tend to come home from work, cook the tea and then sit in the lounge chair in a vegetative state looking at all the colours on the television. I have no energy to do anything let alone be creative at the moment. Having said that, I was so excited about having a scrapping day with my Mum over the four day Easter break. We had a lovely day of chatting, laughing and scrapping and I actually got a few layouts completed, a couple of pages in my Art Journal, as well as some cards that I will give to a good cause when I get a few more completed. It's been raining here on and off all day and I was planning to sew, but instead I have been curled up on the couch, catching up with a friend, enjoying a good old laugh and chat. So...............tomorrow, I will be sewing! I am hoping to have a quilt finished for my youngest son who will be turning 13 in July. I have chosen the fabrics and started doing all the cutting so, tomorrow, I am hoping to start sewing it together.  Fingers crossed that all goes to plan. Well I'm going to call it a day and head to bed but before I do, I wanted to share some of the layouts I did over the Easter break.  Katey and mum On this page I have used some paper doilies as masks, sprayed the whole page with Glimmer Mist. Then, using an eye dropper, I randomly dropped several different colours of 'mists' from the top of the page.  I tried to replicate the graffiti wall that Katey and I were standing in front of.  This page is very different to what I would normally do but I am extremely happy with the outcome just the same.  Matty This page I have used Glimmer Mist again by lightly misting the entire base page and then dripping some 'splotches' onto the page.  I wasn't overly happy with the way that looked as I thought they looked too much like paint 'splotches' so while the mist was still wet, I poked holes through them from the back of the page to make them look a little bit more like water drops.  Then I layered another colour of blue cardstock to the back to make it look like the colour of the water in the spa.    Washi tape This is one of the Art Journal pages that I completed.  I started it in March and have only just got back to it to finish it. It was inspired by the amazing Donna Downey. If you haven't already done so, please go and check out her blog.  She is one amazingly talented lady.  I love this page and I LOOOOOOVE washi tape! I have been buying my washi tape from Sawyers Place. Just for a few laughs, I bought mum and I some bunny ears (it was Easter after all and we had to get in to the spirit of things).  We wore them all day!!  Bunny ears Hahahahahaha! Till next time, keep creating, SUE
AED5023Elearning_Blog3_PMI on Making Sense of Blended Learning by Sir John Daniel  Technology is here and it is not going anywhere.  It will continue to evolve and it will create more ripples of changes.  So what else to do then use it?  Introducing the Blended Learning as one approach to educating learners.  Here is a PMI of this learning or teaching approach drawing from a  2017 paper by Sir John Daniels entitled  MAKING SENSE OF BLENDED LEARNING: TREASURING AN OLDER TRADITION  OR FINDING A BETTER FUTURE? Plus  - Learners can access the learning materials anytime and anywhere - Instructors can customised their lesson plans according to learners' needs  - Learners can study and undergo assessments at their own pace -Teachers learn to innovate on how to develop learning opportunities that can be done either face to face or online -Learners become more interactive and engaging especially when everyone are tech-savvy Minus -Learners have to have enough self-discipline and motivation to continue through  their blended learning journey  -Instructors get overworked because of too much demands on marking students' output, finding and putting up the right sources and making the right decisions which portions of their syllabus can be done face to face or online - When there are no proper rules or etiquette in placed for online learning, conflicts can arise due communication styles and cultural diversities Interesting - Blended learning needs proper transition for both learners and teachers, from face to face classroom teaching to virtual classroom.  - Learners may be good at using technology for social interaction such as using social media but when it comes to professional and educational transactions, they still need to be taught how to properly utilise technolog/y This leads me to the observations of A.W. Bates (2015) about using blended learning which all educators should remember: "The use of technology needs to be combined with an understanding of how students learn, how skills are developed, how knowledge is presented through different media and then processed, and how learners use different senses for learning. It means examining different approaches to learning, such as construction of knowledge compared with a transmission model of teaching, and how technology best works with either approach. Above all, it means linking the use of technology to the specific requirements of a particular knowledge domain or subject area." Reference: Daniel, J. (2016). Making sense of blended learning: Treasuring an older tradition or finding a better future. Online Learning News, Contact North-March, 2.
Everyone Has A Dark Place  "Everyone has a dark place. I barely know a soul who hasn׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t been in therapy or at least should have been. Normally when people hit  things with their scooters, there are skid marks on the pavement. A brick wall is a good reason to use the brakes, turn the wheel. But you didn׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t do that did you? You went straight in." Silence. Continuing, "It says here that the attendant told the police you were upset before you got on the scooter. The insurance company is going to check the engine, brakes, but I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢d prefer to just ask you." Silence. Silence. Then, "I've been told how we think can actually change the chemistry of our brains. I keep thinking that if I just smile and pretend it׳’ג‚¬ג„¢ll all change. You know, be positive. Try and change my chemistry with my thoughts. Destroy it before it destroys you." "When you resist me like this I think it׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s indicative of a deeper problem. Are you angry with me?"  She forces a fake smile. "The problem with a crazy person is they tend to stay crazy." "You're not crazy." "He was the first person I felt pretty around.  I lost him because I was sad and he didn׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t want to stay inside a sad person. He tried to give me so much and I sent him away. I wanted to give him a daughter." Up now he takes her by the shoulders and looks into her eyes repeating, "You're not crazy. Depression is a real illness. It׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s just as real as cancer, but it׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s not in your blood. It׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s in your brain." "I know I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢m sick, but the woman who did this lives in a pill bottle. She׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s not me. I hope you know that. But I let her out-- I let her onto my scooter. If I could change that-- I would. I would do anything. If I could change places with that scooter. I would give my life if there was someone who could make him have stayed." "It is hard, but the hopelessness you feel is a symptom. It׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s like a fever when you have the flu. But, it goes away." "I don׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t understand how this could happen. How can a drug do this to someone? You see the commercials on TV-- people are getting better." He takes this in releasing her shoulders saying, "Sit back down... you're not crazy. The dosage had to be too strong. We'll fix that." "They don׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t even know how half of these things work. It׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s just a big chemistry experiment in sad people׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s brains. People need to know what can happen... that this can happen. No! I don't want that... crap. There׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s like a poisonous fog bank rolling in on my mind on that stuff. I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢m paralyzed. My motivation in taking them was to get over my depression and have a life with my man. That׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s my answer. This is the drug's answer. I've ran him away! We go to doctors with our sadness and our faith in the hope they will guide us toward health-- but  instead I have gone down a path toward a misery I never could have imagined. And I have taken my loved one with me. My only hope is that no one else follows me to this place." "To be guilty you need to have not just been guilty of the act-- but in your mind as well. If you can׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t remember doing it, then you can׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t even begin to know why you did it." "Right, so I want off this crap... now."  "You׳’ג‚¬ג„¢re the victim of circumstances and chemistry. You've blamed myself. The cardiologist can see it coming, the heart attack-- it׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s in the blood-- but who can see the sadness? And I know I should have hope, but hope is just people waiting for the bus.  But, I know that׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s a trick the disease plays. You told me that hopelessness is just a symptom. I have been studying up on depression and most of the time it goes away in 6-18 months. Less with treatment. That gave me hope... now this." "You seem so sad. I know what it׳’ג‚¬ג„¢s like for your life to change out from underneath you. I guess the difference is you didn׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t do anything wrong, you did. Take me off this stuff. I want to go home." "You can't just now, just yet that is. You, ah, just tried to... kill yourself." "You, your pills tried to kill me you mean. Look, I'll stay until this stuff is out of my system. I don't want anything while I'm here. Do I make myself clear? I'll deal with this. I always have. I was better off... real."

January 2017 Favourites! Helloooo!  January was a very full on month for me! But that didn't stop me from finding some favourites! Okay, These aren't all physical objects but I've been on a sorta spending ban! And I've been binging a lot! One thing I enjoyed the most about January was I spent a lot of time with friends! And when you're a stay at home mum it's important you get out of the house and have fun! So last month was definitely the month of fun and making memories! Anyway, Here's my favourites! My Pink Lavender Kikki K! About two months ago I bought a personal sized pink lavender kikki k, because I loved how beautiful it looked! Then I discovered it was too small, SO I purchased a Happy Planner and it was easily one of the best decisions I've ever made! After I bought it I just dived into the planner world, And accumulated plenty of washi tape and stickers! Youtube "plan with me" videos filled my subscription feed! Then Kikki k threw a Three for the price of two sale, And a lovely lady on a planner page was selling her third Large Pink lavender planner for a very reasonable price! Naturally, I wrote "sold". Then I got thinking "Maybe I could have the best of both worlds and merge my Happy planner with my Kikki k?" I did a quick youtube search and sure enough I wasn't the only planner with this amazing idea! So I cut the existing holes from my HP (happy planner), Punched new ones and put them into my kikki k! Tada! My very own, very cute Frankenplanner! Lemme Know if you want a separate post all about my gorgeous planner! My Next two faves are part of the skincare family, Last November I decided that I needed to slow down when it came to skincare! Skincare brands just kept reaching out to me asking for product reviews And I had to stop accepting them because my skin was going through too much! So I went on the hunt for a new skincare regime! I swapped out ALL my products and found one's that truly work for me! I'm not going to get all into it, I plan on making a separate post about the products! But I am going to feature the Hydraluron Moisture jelly* and the Neutrogena Hydro Boost eye roller! I've owned the Hydro boost roller for a while now but never really reached for it! But this heat is playing with my skin and making my under eyes really dry! I haven't noticed a change in my "bags" while using it but it has a cooling roller and feels amazing, It's really been adding some moisture! As for the Moisture jelly, this ones a newbie! I've seen this one insta for a while now and always wanted to try it! I'll be honest guys (like always) it appeared on my doorstep thanks to a PR company and i'll admit I squealed just a little! My favourite thing about this product is the pump! It's located at the top of the jar and basically you push down on it and it kind of like pops of the top! It's so hard to explain but im obsessed with it! I've been using this both morning and night, and i'm very happy with the results! It's a very nice light weight moisturiser! Digital faves: Through out December and January I was Hooked on one show, And that was Shameless US! Everyone kept telling me to watch it but the description on Netflix wasn't making me feel anything! But on one boring day I thought "why not?" And haven't looked back since! This show isn't for the easily offended! Its about a family living in the "south side" of Chicago, The dads an Alcoholic/drug addict, Their mother keeps coming in and out of their lives and the eldest dropped out of school to care for her five younger siblings! I would go into detail about the whole family but there is just so much to say! And I don't wan't to spoil any of the Seven seasons! I've finished them all but may re watch a few since they are starting to film season eight in May! Lets Just say there's a whole lot of drinking, sex and family fights! A you tube channel I've been loving is Mr.Kate! Kate is creative weirdo who loves good DIY and Interior design! Kate and her Husband Joey have a couple of series on the channel including "OMG we bought a house" in Each episode they redecorate a room in their house! A series I've been loving is "OMG we're coming over" In this series they go over to famous you tubers, or digital Influencers homes and renovate a room or two! Each episode is roughly 40 mins long and I always get excited when they upload! I'm also loving Kate's Vlogs and DIY vids! Oh by the way; They're are soooo close to the big One MILLION! And when they reach it they will be giving away a Room Transformation worth $10,000! Okay Guy's I have soooo many more favourites but I think this post is already a little long! So i'll pop them in next favourites! What did you enjoy in January? Are any of these your favourites? x
Happy Birthday Shana!! Sheesh!  How long has it been since I last posted?!?!?!  Anyway, we won't go there. I have recently completed a quilt for a gorgeous friend of mine, Shana.  It was her 40th birthday and I wanted to do something special for her.  You only turn 40 once you know. She loves the colours red, black and white so that made choosing the colours for her quilt quite easy.  I also wanted to incorporate something to do with fashion in to it.  Shana always dresses impeccably and is an avid follower of all things fashion and accessories.  Not only from the modern age but also from different decades.  So that was my theme sorted!  I managed to locate some gorgeous images from www.fashion-era.com.  This is an amazing website which goes through fashion trends etc, for centuries.  I spent so much time on there and it was hard to choose just eight images for the quilt.  Anyway, I managed to find eight different images and the following photos show you some of these. I have used the 'Fat 1/4 Quilt' pattern which is designed by The Quilters Angel and I just added the hand stitched blocks instead of patterned fabric. I got it professionally quilted by Cheryl at Willowberry Designs.  I actually think her quilting business goes under a different name but, for the life of me, I cannot think of it right at this moment.  I started quilting it myself but wasn't happy with the effect.  I am SO happy that I decided to get Cheryl to do it now as it just makes it!  She will be getting all mine from now on.  This is my first quilt I have ever made and am so happy with the finished product.  I am pleased to say that Shana was too.  I seriously have the bug now and am keen to complete another couple that I have started and left to the side.  The next quilt that I have to finish (or start) is one for my youngest son Matt who will be turning 13 in July.  He's been at me for some time to make me a blue and green quilt so I guess I had better get started. Here's Shana's quilt.  The photos aren't great I'm sorry because my camera is on it's last legs.  If you head to Cheryl's blog, she has a photo of it on there.  Shana  Shanas quilt 1  Shanas quilt 2 Shanas quilt 4 Shanas quilt 5 Shanas quilt 6  Shanas quilt 7 These are just a few of the images.  I hope you have enjoyed having a look. Till next time, Sue
Challenge Yourself to a New Weight Loss Goal For the Perfect Booty!  Setting goals is a fantastic way to motivate yourself, especially if you are looking to get a perfectly toned ass! Of course what you’re trying to achieve is a goal in itself but setting shorter goals gives you something that you can aim for in a shorter term and that then means you get the satisfaction of feeling as though you’re making progress as you tick things off of your list.  This is why ‘gamification’ works so well as a way to motivate yourself through challenges. This means turning an objective into a game that you can score yourself on. This feedback loop provides incentive and reward and helps you to measure your improvement. You can even use pictures to see your booty change week by week and keep you motivated!  The only problem? Not many people know how to set goals. Read on then and we’ll look at how setting the right goal can be the perfect tool to help you complete those challenges.  The Hallmarks of a Good Goal How can a goal be either ‘good’ or ‘bad’?  Well, a bad goal would be something that was a) out of your control and b) too distant to be useful.  This is actually what most resolutions and weight loss goals look like. If your goal is to ‘lose 30lbs by 2017’ then your goal is both somewhat out of your control and too distant and vague. Losing 30lbs is an ambitious goal but even if you had a smaller target, you can’t guarantee you’ll ever do it. Different people respond differently to different training and that means you could work really hard for the next two years and not see any results. Most likely you’d give up long before then after becoming disheartened. Not much use!  Instead then, try a goal like this: “I will exercise three times a week for the next 8 months”. This is a goal that is now incredibly achievable because it’s so much nearer. At the same time, it’s a very binary thing that you can either complete or not – and it’s entirely down to you whether it happens. Funnily enough The 8 Week Booty Workout is 3 times a week for 8 weeks, sounds like the perfect goal to start with!  If you focus on smaller, tightly controlled goals like this, then you’ll find that you get more of a feeling of reward and that the ‘overarching’ goals take care of themselves.  What are some other goals you could set up like this? Good examples might be to not eat X for a week, or to increase your running time by 2 minutes every training session for the next 20 sessions.  Why not try downloading The 8 Week Booty Workout and make that your starter goal for the next 8 weeks? It has all the training worked out for you and even has videos to demonstrate each exercise so it couldn’t be easier. It also has the nutritional plan you’ll need to maximise your results so, not only would you look better but you will also lose weight at the same time! Make it your goal to complete the 8 weeks of workouts and nutrition and make sure you send us your before and after pictures so we can add you to our transformations wall.
30 Day Writing Challenge: One I've had this writing challenge saved in my phone since 10/21/2015. Almost four whole years it's sat collecting tech dust. I was recently cleaning out my photos, like a real deep clean. I mean deleting photos  and screenshots of shit that I don't need. And the stuff I wanted to keep, I kept, but on my hard drive.  I always feel lighter with less. I mean, that sentence makes sense but a lot of people like to hold on tight to everything all the time. I do here and there but letting go of shit is so nice. I wanted to let go of this writing prompt but I figured before I do I'd actually do it. That was the whole point of me saving it all of those years ago, right? So here we go, every day for the next 30 days I'll post my answer to random topics. I haven't done a month long challenge in awhile so I'm excited to start this.  Day One Five Problems With Social Media Privacy - Remember when no one knew what you were up to on a Tuesday night unless they called you to ask or even stopped by unannounced because they were in the neighborhood?! Those days weren't so long ago but they sure seem like it. Most of us choose the level of privacy we want to have when it comes to social media. Some of us only post a couple times a month and others share their day to day. Sure, we all get to be curators for our own feeds but how many times to you have to tell a friend to specifically not post a certain photo or maybe you have a drunken night and it all seems fine in the moment but afterwards you wish it could've been a more private night out. Someone somewhere is always filming and posting something.  Pressure - I know a lot of people feel pressure when it comes to their bodies and I've certainly had my moments where I see a celebrity post a gorgeous shot of themselves and think "man, I wish my insert body part here looked like hers" but I've always felt more pressure with the kinds of things I'm posting. I used to overthink if anyone even cares what I have to say in my social media "voice". Is this photo worthy to pop up in my friend's feed? Is the lighting ok? Is it clear enough? Is it interesting enough? Am I enough? How ridiculous is that? Finally I started to not give a shit and now I post things that either bring ME joy (even if they aren't necessary a instagram worthy shot) or something I care deeply about.  Time - This is my biggest problem with social media. I do the insta scroll, then the twitter scroll, then the FB scroll and start all over again until I actually get up and do something productive with my time. I think everyone is guilty of having time sucked away by "the endless scroll". I've gotten better but I'm still a scrollaholic. It takes a lot of effort and reminders to myself to actually put my phone down. I've made huge strides but I'm still a work in progress.  Less screen time and more living life time is always the goal. Some days are easier than others. Mental Health - I've read article after article about how much social media can affect your mental health. It can lead to anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and social isolation or contribute to some of these health issues. It can be hard when you see a constant stream of the people you follow accomplishing their goals or going on vacations or having "perfect" family interactions - not because you aren't happy for them but because maybe something has happened in your own life so when you see a post it triggers you in a way you can't help.  Bullying - Social media makes it so much easier for people to be dicks to one another. I just heard of the term "finsta" aka a fake instagram account. I mean, this is nothing new. We've all created random screen names for various inter web activities but a lot of time these finsta accounts are so people can hide under yet another layer of anonymity so they can spew their hate that much more. 
The Challenge. Hubs and I were talking the other night and the topic of weight came up. Well, more accurately, our mutual desire to lose it. He has lost quite a bit in the last few months and has done great. I've hovered within the same ten pounds since mid-December and, really, it's time to get out of them and down to a lighter number.  So, we have a challenge going. The goal is to each lose 20 pounds and while we have the same time frame to lose it, I am slightly concerned that I tend to plateau very quickly. Of course, I also tend to eat chocolate, so that might explain it. HOWEVER, this is a challenge I simply MUST NOT lose!  Know why?  Because if I lose (not happening!), I have to do laundry - wash and fold - for EVERYONE, ALONE for SIX MONTHS! You all know how much I love laundry. Laundry, to me, is like a splinter embedded in my EYE. And there is no WAY I want a splinter embedded in my eye for SIX MONTHS!  So, I have from now until New Years' to lose 20 lbs. That's 12 weeks away....about 2 pounds a week.
The Chronicles of Nostalgia What a difference an hour can make. Last night I screamed until my throat was raw, and waved my arms until I couldn't feel them anymore, at the Westlife concert in the Cardiff International Arena. That alone probably makes me sound like a twelve year old, when in fact I'm 22 this month, but the utter exhilaration I felt when they were singing all the golden oldies that I used to listen to locked up in my room, was really reminiscent of my tweenage years, when we were so in love with these bands that we thought our hearts would break if we didn't meet them. So, on a nostalgic high, my friend and I drove back to Swansea with Westlife as the soundtrack to our journey, blaring out of the speakers of her little Fiat with us croaking along to all the words. It was only as we pulled up to my flat that I was reminded that I am not a pre-teen anymore, sheltered from the big bad world by a mollycoddling mother and a group of friends whose idea of hell raising was getting slightly tipsy in our parent's houses. No, I am now an adult, albeit a student at the moment, living in a world where empty cans of lager, the smell of urine, and a couple rubbing cocaine into their gums, all at the front door to my flat, is rife. Is it too much to ask that when I come home late at night, I do not have to trip over bottles of beer and be overwhelmed by the pungent stench of piss? Or should I just wake up, and recognise that my cloistered yet complacent childhood is far behind me?
#100happydays (Day #2)  Hmmmm, I had a bit of a rough day today. I was really looking forward to a nice walk with my friend, Tracy, and her two dogs. She was also dog-sitting for two other families so she had six dogs to bring.  Not too far into the walk, her Boston Terrier got stung by a fire ant became increasingly distressed due to the pain.  We took turns carrying the dog until we got back to the cars.  After that, I took the dogs (just my two dogs) to get Round 2 of their Rattlesnake Vaccinations at the vet hospital.  We are good to go for a year.  Yay!   After bathing the dogs, I had to run to town to mail packages at the post office.  It's tourist season. It's just too crowded on the roads and, I kid you not, it seemed as if I witnessed at least a half dozen near car accidents in the space of about 3.5 miles.  I kept trying to not let this stuff make me grumpy but it really had me torked.  I went to the knit shop to knit just a bit with my friends again and then I was off to the grocery store.  Ugh, more bad drivers along the way and the store was super crowded.  I kept telling myself to TRY to not let this stuff get to me, but I was really struggling.  I had to hurry home to make an appointment at 2:00 pm.    The appointment went great!  We had a man come to the house about estimates for granite counter overlays in the kitchen.  We were so impressed by the salesman, Ryan, and also impressed by the product.  It's a man-made product which is 95 percent granite and 5 percent polymer.  It's not porous and requires no sealing like granite does.  It's also sturdier and is guaranteed for life.  We had no trouble selecting what granite we want to use in the kitchen and the price was agreeable to us. We decided to have the salesman take a gander at our bathroom as we were considering a shower enclosure in the master bathroom.  I think I am in LOVE with the selections we made for the bathroom even MORE than the kitchen.  And since we were giving the company a good amount of business, they said they would complete the second bathroom countertop and add a new sink for just $100.00.  And the beauty of this company's product... it all gets installed in one day!  These house fix ups are long overdue. We've lived here 22 years and the kitchen and bathrooms were in dire need of some sprucing up.  We are spending more money than we'd like, but hopefully we'll see a return on our investment someday when we sell our home.  In the meantime, I KNOW we will enjoy these really nice improvements in our home!  Happyness is... looking forward to sprucing up the home I love so much!
Time to plant seeds! What should we plant in February and March? Day 1, parsley and thyme Day 22, parsley and thyme Hello everyone! Although it may not be spring officially yet, the outside tells us different! Nature is slowly waking up, so this is the best time to plant seeds. They say "What you plant you harvest" so make sure you make it right.  What herbs should I plant?  Let's see. The most common herbs people use in kitchen are parsley, basil, thyme, oregano and dill. Guess what! You can plant them now. All of them are heat loving so make some space at home and by the time it's warm enough outside, you can have little plants ready for your outside garden. You can plant them indoors as well, just like me and other people who don't have garden.  How to plant seeds:  You need: seeds, light, water, proper soil (I buy special soil mix for herbs) and some plastic containers or flowerpots (one for each kind of seeds) 1) fill the containers with soil, let 3 cm space on top 2) sprinkle the soil with water and according to instructions on the each packet plant the seeds (especially mind the depth and distance between them) 3) put 1-2 cm of soil (the bigger plant is going to grow, the more soil you put) on top and slightly sprinkle with water again. 4) let it grow on a sunny place and every 2 days sprinkle with water. Remember, seeds take some time to grow :) Tip: Have you heard about Community gardens? A community garden is a single piece of land gardened collectively by a group of people. They could be small areas where people grow small plots of vegetables, to large "greening" projects to preserve natural areas, to tiny street beautification planters on urban street corners. Some grow only flowers, others are nurtured communally and their bounty shared. It can be a great way to meet new people and make some friends with mutual hobby. It could be a solution for those who don´t have a garden of their own (most likely people in big cities). In most cases, gardeners are expected to pay annual dues to help with garden upkeep, and the organization must manage these fees. The tasks in a community garden are many, including upkeep, mulching paths, recruiting members, and fund raising. There could be a lot of fun, too. Community meetings, support, and romantic bonfires where you can "hear the veggies grow" in the night.   
Ironman, I am not I think I was having visions of grandeur.  I had a little pep in my step yesterday and was getting things crossed off my to do list.  I promised myself last week I would follow through with my cross training and abs.  Tuesday, I barely got my abs in but I did do them.  So Wednesday comes and, like I said I was highly motivated, I decided to go to a one hour spin class at my gym. [love love love spin class] That was from noon to one.  I got home and new I needed to get my run in before the ladies got out of school, otherwise it might not get done due to dinner having to be made, a quick grocery run, dance practice for Miss J and a mandatory vegan baking fest for me.  I almost didn't run because in between all that, I needed to eat!  Green monster down and out I went.  Mistake number two.  I really didn't want to run right after having eaten but I figured I had get out there.  Hello side cramps!!  Let's head back to mistake number one, not allotting my self enough time.  I was down to the wire.  I had only 45 minutes to get a 42 min run in.  That had to include the driving time back to the house.  High five to myself, I got it done and met Miss R right after she had gotten off the bus.  That messed with my focus because I was worried about getting home on time.  Mistake number three, spin class then less than an hour later, run.  For some, this may be nothing but for this lady, legs felt like I was running through sand!  All of my lower body was feeling it.  I was wanting to quit the whole time. Enter the self talk.  I knew a yucky run was inevitable, I had been having way too many good ones.  I kept thinking, I hate running!!! success is hanging on when you want to let go.  I had to analyze what I was doing/did wrong and what I could learn from it.  See mistakes one through three.   Don't eat so close to running Run before spin class or other classes Make enough time for a run so I don't have worries about being somewhere.  I can just focus on the run. Most importanly....Schedule/plan better! Lessons learned.  This is the life of a running, working, full-time mom. 
How to find a recipe based on the ingredients you have I got quite annoyed the other day of browsing through my recipe books to look for recipes which would use up specific ingredients which needed using. A quick google found this site: http://www.supercook.com/ In the green 'add ingredient' box you simply start typing the ingredients you need to use one at a time and then suitable recipes will come up and they'll ask in green at the bottom if you have other ingredients needed for the recipe or there will be a nice big green tick to show you have everything you need. Very Handy!
Super Tired This will be short and sweet because I am super tired and I'm off to bed. I left bright and early for work this morning and got to spend twenty minutes with the boys at the Seat of Knowledge. They were being harassed by a little 14 month old girl 'Crazy Z' who was as bright as a button, giggling all over the place and full of beans. They were loving every minute of it! It was a happy start to my day. There were customers waiting well before 9am so I opened early to serve them. The next hour was dead as a doornail, but from there we were kept pretty busy with a steady flow of people through the door. There was enough time between customers or with both of us taking turns to serve them as they came in, to work on our vision boards. Mine is almost finished, with all of my pictures, words and quotes glued in place and all I need to do is add my own creative artwork. The Motivator made great inroads into her vision board too. We've been trying to create these boards since around February! We made a big order of Ivys bags, hats and scarves which we hope will be delivered by the end of next week. Our doors weren't closed until around 2.30pm and it was almost 3.30pm when I arrived home. We have a breakfast date with friends in the morning so I need a good nights sleep to be up bright and early again. Have a great Sunday.
Essential Items To Take Abroad As I've just come back off holiday, I thought I'd do a post on the essential items you should pack in your suitcase, based off my experience. So here goes! 1. Suncream - Do not underestimate this stuff! I thought I could get away with factor 30 on my pale English skin  but alas, I could not, and both the backs of my legs and my back were severly burnt. I ended up buying factor 50 while I was over there, which cost a ridiculous 17 euro. Lesson : go one up than what you think, and then drop down towards the end of your holiday. 2. Germolene - Me and my friends ended up using a full tube of this while we were away. It soothed our bites, cuts, scrapes and rashes.   3. Insect Repellent - Because my friend ended up with 22 bites, three being on her face, although we all had at least one.  4. Travel Wash - This was so useful on my two week holiday. As we only had a 15KG weight allowance we had to pack mix and match items, so at least we could have reasonably clean clothes to wear for a second or third time! And it only cost one pounds from the pound shop. 5. Face Wipes - Sometimes, you just cannot be bothered to wash your face properly.  6. Urban Decay Primer Potion (or any primer of choice) 7. One eyeshadow palette 8. One black eyeliner 9. Mascara (wouldn't really recommend waterproof, you won't end up wearing it by the pool and its a bugger to get off at night) 10. Bronzer 11. One lipstick 12. Lipbalm with SPF 13. Makeup brushes 14. Anti bacterial hand gel 15. Contact lenses and a pair of glasses for those with bad eyesight like me! 16. At least two pairs of sunglasses 17.Body puff for the shower 18. Hairspray 19. Aftersun (a good one with medical properties in case you get badly burnt, also keep it in the fridge if you have one) 20. Bobbles/ grips 21. Moisturiser 22. Deodorant 23. Perfume 24. Toothbrush 25. Hairbrush 26. A plastic bag for used underwear 27. Medicine - paracetamol, Imodium 28. Anti chafing gel  Things that you can sort out between people who are sharing rooms:- 29. Hair dryer 30. Ipod speakers (good ones that will blast your tunes out - one guy from our apartments took an amp! Good for partying, bad for luggage allowance) 31. Straightners 32. Plasters 33. Shampoo / Conditioner/ Showergel 34. Razors (buy a bigger pack and share them, and use conditioner as shaving gel) 35.Toothpaste / mouthwash  Also, if you have a small baggage allowance, make sure you mix and match outfits and leave enough space in your hand luggage to transfer items in case you're over the weight allowance. When you get to the airport, weigh your suitcase on one of the un manned desks, because 80% of the time you will be over, but you'll have enough time to deal with it. One of my friends was 3KG over the limit, but because we weighed our cases as soon as we got in she was able to transfer some stuff to her hand luggage and other people's cases who had come under weight.  Hope that was useful! xxx

Lemon juice face mask after reading a post by bubblegarm, who by the way is one of my favourite bloggers, i decided to try and use lemon juice as a face mask... my skin isn't 'bad' and i don't really get alot of spot, but when i do they always leave blemishes.. and i never only get one spot, they always come together. so my skin either looks really good or kinda bad. anyway so i read the post by bubblegarm when my skin was going through a bad patch and therefore decided to give it a go, especially since it was highly recommended. instead on putting it on for 5 minutes in the morning, i treated it like a mask and left it on over night. what i liked about it: oh my! the different is amazing, my blemishes definitely lightened after id say 2 days, this was especially noticeable on my for head. it really helped even out my skin tone. the skin on my for head and around my mouth had always been ever so slightly darker than the skin on the rest of my face, weird i no, and it always bothered me, but the lemon juice has really evened all of that out:) it's natural! which is always a bonus. my skins really improving by using something that doesn't cost much money at all! what i didn't like about it: it stings!... but if you just leave it on it does carm down. it feels a bit sticky which can be annoying if you want to leave it on over night like i do. i suffer from dry skin anyway, and using lemon juice just made it worse, but i make sure i use a thick moisturiser in the morning, so it's not to bad. my final verdict: i think the pros definately out-weight the cons! i recommend using lemon juice on the face, it really works! here's a picture of me from yesterday with no foundation onjust a thought though, with lemons being highly acidic is that not bad in anyway for the skin... does any one know? thanks for reading! x
Taking a Leap of Faith This week's literacy post is going to be based off of something that I am currently dealing with. On May 26, 2011, I walked across a stage and received a piece of paper that culminated my time at Troy University. With that piece of paper came a strong sense of pride and joy, then a crash of WHAT NOW??  So many people go through this is life, be it graduation, like me, or a job layoff, or even a relocation to another area. As I write this I am reminded of the last time I felt the "what now." The summer of my sophomore year of high school, my best friend told me that she would be moving to another state for a while. Prior to this news, we were inseparable, so obviously I was crushed. What I did then, and what I am doing now as I go out in search for a job is taking a leap of faith.   For I know the plans I have for you," says the LORD. "They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11  As difficult as it is to take this leap of faith, this verse offers me comfort. Tomorrow I take an incredible leap of faith, as I am interviewing for a job! I am excited, and I want to make a good impression. When was the last time you had to take a leap of faith? Ask your child about this, it could be a great conversation starter. I even found some books that discuss life's little unplanned moments, and how we can react to them!    The Berenstain Bears' Moving Day by: Jan Berenstain, Stan Berenstain Summary: This is the story of how the Berenstain Bears moved into their tree-house in Bear Country. Brother Bear is nervous about the move. How will it turn out?  Wings of Change by: Franklin Hill Summary: Wings of Change is the story of Anew, a contented little caterpillar who is afraid to become a butterfly. After experiencing some puzzling dreams, he turns to Faith, a wise old snail, for advice. She gently explains, "As the world turns, so do you. When you change for the good, you change the world too."  update: I didn't get to post this on its intended date, but I do get to post it with some good news! The "leap of faith" was rewarded and the interview went well! Now I just have to wear out my praying knees and see what my next move is.
Jemma Kidd Dewy Radiance Creme | Review firstly - can i get a boohoo for jemma kidd going into administration? this is the saddest news ever! (in the beauty world, at least) i havent been a JK fan for long but my loyalty to the brand has been built up quickly! i know the light as air foundation is a beauty blogger favourite but as it is notoriously hard to get rid of now, i will be doing a quick review on the dewy glow all over radiance creme! (still available - grab it whilst you can! its amazing!) i have this product in the shade 'iced gold', a golden toned highlight as opposed to its 2nd shade 'rose gold' which is more pink toned. this product is essentially a creme highlighter but can be used all over the face to provide a glow and/or on the body to create highlight and definition. i apply this using a screenface dual fibre brush and just sweep it over my cheeks before i apply my setting powder. it can be used with or without a base underneath but i only tend to use it when i have foundation on, to give an extra glow to the skin. this product retails at around £18 so if you can find it anywhere - stock up before it flies off the shelves! i cannot believe JK has gone into administration - i am a huge fan of their creme products including the highlighter and blush. not to mention the thousands of girls now without a foundation! GOD FORBID! did you guys have any favourite jemma kidd makeup school products? emma xo
A rockin' stitch in time.... In reference to the "stitch in time"...Holy side stitches Batman!  I seem to get them in the diaphragm area quite often.  I'm trying to focus on breathing and what not but still seem to get them.  Is there something else I should be doing for these bad mamma-jamma's?  In reference to the "rockin'" in the title, just made a new play list that is making me as giddy as a school girl.  I've been thinking I need to switch it around a little and change the style to keep my running fresh.  Drum roll please!     Today I had three miles on the books.  Woke up to lots of rain, instantly wasn't feeling it.  I had about 4.5 hours of sleep from night shift and was looking for all the excuses in the world to not run.  I ended up sitting in my running clothes, sipping on my coffee, telling myself I didn't have time to run because the ladies would be home any second.    My ma called and said she could pick up kid #1.  Score!  I dropped off kid #2 at dance practice and busted out a nice three miler.  For the run that almost wasn't, I ran all three miles in the 10's.  Huh?  Let me say that again for posterity's sake....I RAN ALL THREE MILES IN THE 10's!!!  Who is this billy bad @$$?!?  Me, that's who!  I don't know if you know this but, I'm kind of a big deal.     After I ran, I promptly fell on the floor at my gram's and the dog tried to revive me in all my schweaty glory.    I know I sound pretty silly being so jazzed and excited about 10+ min miles but ya know, I worked pretty darn hard to get to this point and by gosh by golly I'm proud of myself.  I can't wait to spank my half marathon time in June!  All right, enough fun, off to work some night shift action
The New FatVentures of Old TrishDina You know, I don't like blogging about being on a diet all the time. I don't even like being on a diet, so why the hell would I wanna write about it all the time? When I go over to Jeff's sister's house, she has that book YOU, On a Diet all prominently displayed on her coffee table and I always think "man, what a terrible idea for a book!" Then I see that New York Times #1 Best Seller sticker on the front and I realize that nobody cares what I think, even though it's still a stupid idea for a book. You, On a Diet By: Some Rich Jerk Chapter One: You are hungry. The End. That'll be $34.95. That being said, I kinda like writing about being fat because sometimes being fat is comical, even though it mostly sucks...which is why I'm doing all this dieting business in the first place. So like, I kinda HAVE to write about dieting. Even if I do hate it. Cause I need it. To keep me on track and shit. And so you guys can be all "YOU CAN DO IT" and/or "STOP BEING A FATTIE" depending on how bad/good I'm doing at the time. So I guess for all intents and purposes, this is my dieting blog. It's been with me through the ups and downs and you're all here for me still (amazingly!) and I don't wanna give it up and start a new one and pretend like this isn't my one billionth attempt at weight loss blogging, you know? So I'm definitely keeping it...BUT... Me and Dina do have a new blog. A combo blog! A COMBLOG! It's supposed to be about our adventures being fat girls in the world, but so far it's not really about much. But it'll probably get better because she's awesome and I'm awesome, so I mean, what's the worse that could happen? (complete internet implosion...) There's only a few entries now, but it feels weird not letting you guys in on it, so HERE IT IS! So please...come join us...add us...comment us...often. And as always, thanks for being my bitchin' support system. Even when I give up on myself and disappear for months at a time. You guys rule <3
Off to Europe This may be a very short and/or incoherent post, considering I am leaving for Hungary tomorrow and could hardly sleep 5 hours last night. Nevertheless I find myself here in good faith to my blog. I am very nervous. Only once was I in a foreign-speaking country, and even then were there many who spoke English to me. Here, I am to understand, very few people speak the language. What's worse is that I will be helping run an English camp. Just me and my partner in front of a class who don't speak a word of English. Literally. Needless to say, I am fairly terrified.  On top of this dilemna, I have not finished packing yet. I have a piano lesson that I did not practice for. And I have foolishly scheduled a day of frivolity with some friends, when I hardly have enough time to sleep. I do not know how I shall get it all done, and if I do, in what condition I shall be. I have already packed the essentials for my journey; Yarn, Jane Austen's "Mansfield Park", and some more yarn. It will be a pleasant trip so long as I hold onto those possessions. Ok it's really funny how my whole style of writing has changed since I listened to "Northanger Abbey" by Jane Austen yesterday. It wasn't until I reread the beginning of this post that I noticed how British and odd my diction became. Very amusing. I have no crafts to display, although I have been crafting fervently. have just finished the items for my swap on craftster and will be shipping tomorrow. Which is also when I will be leaving. I also ordered a set of Denise Knitting Needles. I can't wait.  Oh blog, hopefully I will be able to give you more attention when I return. Much <3,  Rach
My roommates noticed my weight loss! Sooo excited! Over the past four months I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢ve been exercising and counting my calories and more recently I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢ve incorporated IF as well and I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢ve lost around 23 pounds! My overall goal is to lose 85 so I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢m about 27% to my goal at this point. I could tell a difference and my fam could tell a difference but I wasn׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t sure if my friends at school would be able to tell. First time I see one of my roommates in four months and she asks if I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢ve lost weight! (And tells me I look super tan so bonus compliment!) I literally gave her a hug and I could have cried I was so happy!  My other roommate didn׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t say anything which I expected bc we aren׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t close and my third didn׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t say anything to me but to the one who told me she noticed she said she did notice but didn׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t want to say anything so yay! Still haven׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t seen any of my other friends yet but I haven׳’ג‚¬ג„¢t told any of them about my weight loss either so I׳’ג‚¬ג„¢m intrigued to see if they notice/say something as well. This was just the motivation I needed to get back on track after the move though-onward and downward!
The Verdict So I have the results back from my scans and it turns out I have torn some ligaments in my knee, but because it is a lot better than it was I just have to keep doing what I have been which is resting it when I can and being gentle with it. I am grateful, it could have been much worse but I am frustrated because now that the weather is getting nicer I had plans for doing fun active outdoorsy stuff which I will have to put on hold. I will be working six days a week for the next couple of weeks which won't leave me much time for anything else but it is only a few weeks before I am on holidays, so excited!
1 Day Detox- Hollywood/Red carpet diet! Hi there :) I have been following a one day detox each week and using the Hollywood diet regime without buying the cleansing drink. I make my own to save ֲ£ֲ£s. About the Hollywood diet The Hollywood Diet originated -surprise -In Hollywood! It claims to be a 48 hour miracle diet, where you are allowed to drink only a specially formulated juice. This juice will be the only thing that you are permitted to consume for the next two days. It contains 100 percent of the necessary vitamins and minerals you need in a regular diet. In theory, you should lose between 5 and 10lbs in the 2 days whilst on the diet, this will vary depending on your metabolism and starting weight. While on the diet you must refrain from drinking alcohol, caffeine based drinks and smoking. The original Hollywood 48 Hour Miracle Diet Juice is a recipe for a 2-day liquid fasting diet, which is a homemade version of "The Hollywood Diet". If you follow it correctly, you can lose up to 10 pounds in 2 days. You will be drinking only liquids for two days. It is recommended that you do not repeat this diet more than once or twice per month. My Version I detox for one day (not 2 like the Hollywood diet) and drink the juice for breakfast and Lunch and make a large soup for the evening. Here is the Hollywood diet drink recipe: Ingredients Juice of 4 oranges Juice of 2 lemons 2 Tbls. Manuka honey 1 banana, peeled and sliced 1 apple peeled and sliced 1 cup of grape juice (can be store bought) Combine the ingredients and blend or stir thoroughly. This will make enough concentrate to last you one day. Add 1 litre or 2 pints of distilled or spring water, and sip the juice throughout the day. If you get thirsty, you may drink only distilled or mineral water. Much of your weight loss will be due to the cleansing properties of the juice. It is estimated one third of the weight lost will be from fat and/or muscle, one third will be water loss, and one third will be fecal and waste matter, which is beneficial as a clean system gives a sense of well being, and allows for a better functioning bowel. I believe whether you decide to make your own juice or buy the original, The Hollywood Diet is a great way to jump start a weight loss program or also to be used as a short detox cleansing diet like for myself.  My cleansing soup 1 teaspoon olive oil 2 cloves of garlic, chopped2 tablespoons diced onion 1 inch of fresh ginger, peeled and chopped4 cups fresh broccoli, cut up1/2 pound of fresh spinach leaves 3 parsnips, peeled, chopped2 ribs of celery, trimmed, chopped handful of fresh parsley, Fresh water, tiny pinch of Sea salt and ground pepper, to taste Lemon or lime juice  Instructions:Using a large soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat and stir in the garlic, onion, and ginger to season the oil. Add the broccoli, spinach, parsnips, celery and parsley, and stir a bit until the spinach wilts and collapses. Add just enough water to cover the vegetables. Remember the spinach will cook down quite a bit, so don't add too much water at first. You can always thin the soup later, if you need to.Bring to a high simmer, cover the pot, and reduce the heat to a medium simmer. Cook for fifteen minutes or so until the veggies are softened.Use an immersion blender to puree the soup. Serve with NO BREAD! :(  When to do the 1 day detox? Well the best time to do this is weekly when there is a change in the Lunar cycle One-day fasting has proven to be a great way to detox your body and improve your immunity. The secret is to juice fast for 24 hours. Only liquids foods may be consumed; and only coinciding with the changes in the moonג€™s cycle. You must begin the at a specific time when the moon enters a new phase. Within those 24 hours you are not allowed to consume any solid food, but you should drink as much water as possible. You can also drink juice but ONLY freshly squeezed juice without sugar or additives. Alcohol and milk are strictly forbidden. Between 3 and 4 litres (6-8 pints) of liquids should be consumed in the 24 hour period.  Within 24 hours you can lose up to 6 lbs if you follow it correctly. There are no possible undesirable effects, if you do begin to feel hungry have a large glass of vegetable juice. The gravity of the moon influences not only oceans and rivers but also body fluids. When the moon changes phases, during the first 24 hours this influence has the greatest potential as it takes 24 hours for the magnetic field of the Earth to change. All this action makes your body let go of it's excess fluids. If you let your body "breathe" for a day, you will lose all the unnecessary water and toxins which are being accumulated in your body as a result of an unhealthy diet, bad digestion and stress. This waste material also makes you gain fat easier. It's important to stress that by following this detox you don't lose fat. You still need to be active and be careful about what you eat. But it is a great way to detox your body and introduce a healthy lifestyle. I'd recommend it as a good introduction to a diet because if you notice a large improvement on the scale in just one day, it will boost your self esteem a lot, which makes losing weight easier. The main thing about this detox is not for weight loss, which is only a pleasant side effect but to detox the body and make you feel light. Since the moon cycle changes once a week, if you practice this diet every week, you can lose and maintain your pcos weight. Of course, you should stick to a balanced diet in between fasting periods with plenty of protein....see my last blog! Next changes in the lunar cycle are 21st Feb 2012, 1st March 2012, 8th, 15th and 22nd March. Give it a go for one day on one of the above dates, see how much you loose the first time? I lost 3lbs my first time, now I ve been following it a while I loose 1lb but it is helping me maintain and keep to my ideal weight for my PCOS. You can do it!

Ofsted's Action on Reading's Primary Schools Last week Labour-run Reading Borough Council (RBC) was slammed by Ofsted for failing primary school children, with over a quarter of pupils not receiving a good education.  Sir Robin Bosher's (Ofsted's South East Regional Director) letter to RBC dated 19 January 2015 was published, together with this press release.  In his letter Sir Robin Bosher said  "there has been a sharp rise in the number of schools judged to be inadequate in Reading since October 2013."  "Two primary schools were judged to be inadequate in October 2014, bringing the total number of schools judged to be inadequate in the last year to six."  The Ofsted Director added that "...the council has failed to take action to prevent schools deteriorating to the point where they now require special measures...the authority has not provided sufficient challenge or support to schools to enable them to improve quickly enough."  As chairman of a local schoolג€™s governing body, I know that strong leadership by the head and senior staff team is fundamental to providing an outstanding education, together with plenty of rigour and challenge from the governing body.  Schools need to use their ability to remove inadequate teachers if the individuals cannot be supported to raise their performance within a short timescale. It is unfair on pupils to have their life-chances impeded by sub-standard teaching.  Schools need to have high aspirations for each child, no matter what the child's background.  Every pupil needs to be supported and inspired by their teachers to achieve to the best of their ability.  You can read GetReading's report here. 
July's Foodie Penpal reveal day................ Well it's that time of the month again, so it must be time for one thing. Reveal day! This month I was selected to send my box to Kimberley @ fullasanegg Apart from a dislike of perfumey (is that a word?) tastes she didn't have any preferences so I was able to run wild with my box. You can see what she thought of it here. I received my box from the lovely Julia @ sthingmissing.    She writes a brilliant blog with recipes that all "have something missing" whether that be gluten, dairy, eggs or meat/animal products proving that you don't have to miss out on great food and treats if you are on a restrictive diet. Her pineapple and coconut semi-freddo recipe is to die for!  I always try and resist peeking at the box's content before I've read the letter, but after reading she'd made me some gingerbread men I just couldn't resist and had to have a quick peek. They looked so cute looking up at me with their wonderful chocolate shoes. She even sent me a cookie cutter and the recipe so I could have a go at making my own. There is only two left in the photo, the rest had already been devoured by my little boy and his friend. I did manage to try one of the remaining ones and it was delicious.  Stevie has helped me eat the Cadbury's chocolate mascot too. It was like eating an Easter egg in the middle of July.  We live near to the City of Coventry stadium where some of the Olympic football matches are being played, so it's nice to get into the spirit of the games (any excuse for chocolate!) I love both mustard and Guinness so I was excited to find this little beauty in my box. I quite like a cheese and mustard sandwich (I'm odd, I know) so that's how I first tried it. The Guinness flavour was very subtle but it was a nice mustard all the same. I'm going to try in my sausage and leek casserole when the weather cools down. I nearly bought plantain chips to go in the parcel I send this month but changed my mind at the last minute so I'm interested in trying them myself, but I haven't got round to sampling them yet.  The thing I'm most excited about is trying Julia's Tom Yam Kung recipe, she sent me. She told be how she had learnt this recipe from the locals at a Thai cookery school whilst travelling in Thailand. She thoughtfully included some of the ingredients for me to use. Lime leaves are not something I would usually keep in my store cupboard so it was fantastic to find them in my box.  Another first for me is white tea. I love spiced tea and enjoying drinking fruit teas in the summer but I like my black tea very, very strong so I wasn't sure if the delicate taste of white tea would be for me. I was actually quite surprised as I really quite liked it. Thanks again go to Julia for putting together my box of treasure.  If you are in the UK and would like to take part next month, fill in the application form here  before the 4th August. If you are reading this from America or Canada they you can join in here 
MORNING  On the Yarra River in the City, looking towards the East on a very nippy Winter's morning in Melbourne. The sunrise colours make it worthwhile to wake up at an ungodly hour! This post is part of the Skywatch Friday meme.
Should I quit working full time? I've been really worried lately because my office job contract is up for renewal in 9 months time and with this current recession I've been told that they aren't resigning contracts at the moment. I get paid really well in my current job and so, intially, I was not too happy about this news. But this morning I woke up with a radical idea in my head. I could move into my studio for a while and therefore afford to be a full time artist again. Granted, I'm going to be broke and sleeping where I work, it will be rough and I have no nice house to go when I'm finished working. But I'm getting so much great feedback about my art and it's all starting to happen for me again. I really think I need to make the sacrifice. I'm missing too many opportunities because I don't have enough time for art. Ok, I'd be broke again, but I'm used to living like an artist, I've done it many times before and I'm pretty good at living on very little money. I really need to focus on my art, beside I can always go back to work, it's not going to be a recession forever. Scary thought though, all that nice money I make, gone , but really I think it's the right time to quit full time office work. So I think I will just walk away in 9 months time. It would be absolulte heaven to wake up each day and say what I am going to create today.
Bring on fall... Fall is one of my favorite times of the year. My favorite is summer, but lately, here in Georgia, it is TOO HOT! Right now the weather is still debatable. Some days it is hot and then some days it is on the chilly side. It is hard to determine what to wear right now! I digress.... Anyway, I love Fall!  Everyone gets out and enjoys the cool temperatures. IT is FOOTBALL season! Nothing is more exciting than that cool air and watching or tailgating with friends while cheering on your favorite college football team...go DAWGS!!!  Families get together and experience different fall festivals!  I attended the 2010 Rock N' Rib Fest in the Lawrenceville Square a few weeks ago. It was so much fun. Good friends, good music, good food! There were so many people out and the weather was amazing! Now it is all about the pumpkins!  I need to get a pumpkin and carve it! I haven't done it since my college roommate and I did a few years ago. I want some pumpkin seeds and maybe try my hand at a pumpkin pie?!? With Halloween just around the corner, it is all about  pumpkins and haunted houses. Which reminds me, what to do for a Halloween costume?!?!? One of my favorite places to travel in the fall is to Charlottesville,Virginia. My uncle and aunt and their girls live up there and we love to go visit them! They live in the college town with UVA a few miles away. Needless to say, there is SO much to do. They are so active and dont waste a minute. The scenery is amazing and we often spend some time at the Virginia vineyards!  I am still looking for that favorite wine (red and white)! Any suggestions?! Anyway, it is just a nice escape for a few days. There is not much hustle and bustle and it is peacefull and quiet!  I would love to get back there while it is still nice and with the leaves all pretty and changing colors! Another event I like to attend is Helen's Oktoberfest! This is in Helen, Georgia every year and it is something to see if you have never been. The town is jammed packed. People from all around come to experience the shopping, the scenery, and well, the GERMAN BEER! The people are, let's just say, interesting and leave it at that!There is a lot to see and do. Horse drawn buggies(sorry, I am from the south), street side entertainment, pubs, and my favorite- candy apples! What are your favorite things to do in the Fall?   Candice
19TH BIRTHDAY HAIR AND MAKEUP Now you may or may not know but last Thursday (23rd October) was my 19th birthday and therefore I thought I would post what I did with my hair and makeup! Considering my birthday celebrations went from day to night I decided to do something that would fit for both times of day. My makeup was just all neutral, incorporating pink and gold . Unfortunately the pictures are not showing the warmth and deep rose gold or the crazy, fantastic glitter from my MAC pressed pigment but it is showing the general look! I decided to curl my hair with GHD straighteners as I know, for me, this is as quick as straightening. I went for beachy waves, however at the moment I am using a Primark mini jaw clip to clip up the front sections of my hair. This is just due to the fact that whilst my ear piercings are still healing I'm desperately trying to not get my hair caught! (Showering is difficult I tell you!) Products used: (From left to right) MAC: Expensive Pink Eyeshadow (Bottom Left of Palette) - Used on lid MAC: Embark Eyeshadow (Bottom Right of Palette) - Used in crease MAC: Blonde Streak Pressed Pigment Used on lid - This is so incredibly glittery! MAC: Hue Lipstick MAC: This and That Eyeshadow - Cream colour - Used as inner corner highlight Rimmel: Wassup Eyeshadow - Used in crease Urban Decay: Half Baked Eyeshadow - Used on lid Grimas: 892 Lipliner Above with flash. Above without flash. Taken on phone to try and show warmth.  Pin on Pinterest Hope you enjoyed this look!  I'm a bit gutted that you can't see the full amazing impact the eye makeup look made! Love El xxx
Weight Loss Occurs After 4 days on the Atkin's Diet, I've lost 4.5 lbs. As opposed to the 1lb I lost eating a balanced diet and working out almost everday for the month before that.  I don't recommend the Atkin's diet to just anyone - it has a very specific target of people.  However, if you've attempted the balanced and calorie controlled diet, have exercised regularly, and have decent cholesterol and blood pressure and still have not lost any weight, I would strongly suggest discussing this option with your doctor.  Its target is Insulin-resistant people. And its "low-carb" associations are mostly myth - such as you are only allowed a certain number of over-all carbs a day. This diet requires you to get fiber in your system in large quantities while limiting the amount of carbs that affect your blood sugar levels. Fiber doesn't do this, but simple sugars do (like what a candy bar is largely made up of). So in the first phase, I'm limited to 15-20 "net" carbs (carbs that are not fiber or sugar alcohols), I can get about 5 Fiber carbs for every one simple sugar I eat - if I pick the right foods.  Its working, so I guess that says everything, right?
Back to the Drawing Board #FWTFL  I am here now and that's all that matters! Well, it's been too long since my last blog. Unfortunately, that means that I haven't had much to talk about in the health and fitness world. I am not sure how it's gotten away from me, but it has.   Rather than beating myself up about it, I am going to forgive myself and move on. Thank you all for joining me on this new endeavor... the road to healthy living!  I have tried so many different weight loss plans over the years and failed. I am the queen of verbal abuse to myself and comforting myself with food. NO MORE! Not happening anymore!   I have been reading the book Atomic Habits by James Clear. You read more about it HERE: Atomic Habits on Amazon. He talks about how negative thoughts produce more negative thoughts and that we can have big goals, but that can cause disappointment. The better plan is to change by 1%. Just be 1% better and then celebrate the victories! I love it. I have always said, "I want to lose 50 lbs (or whatever)"  And then when I didn't lose it in 30 days, I would feel frustrated and want to quit. NO MORE! I want to make small changes and see the difference.  I have decided to do the FASTer Way to Fat Loss׳³ֲ²ײ²ֲ²׳²ֲ²ײ²ֲ® program. This program was created Amanda Tress and I have see HUGE changes in lives! Not just weight loss, rather in overall health. It's all about creating healthy habits.  This program begins on Monday. I am excited to get it going. I will be documenting this 6 week program here. My coach is Jordan Rothwell and she has made huge changes and looks incredible.  She feels great too!   You can learn more about it here. FASTer Way to Fat Loss  Today I am still working on understanding the program. I am very excited. It is a plan that I feel I can get on board easily! It makes complete sense too.  I have already started fasting. We do an intermittent fast daily.  I will be fasting every day from 7pm til 11 am. This allows for the body to burn fat. I am excited about it. I have done it this week and believe it or not, it isn't that hard. When I really wanted to eat something the other night, I just went to bed. LOL... worked perfectly!  I cannot wait to get started and I will be sharing the journey! Have you ever heard about this program? Do you know anything about it?
CLASS REVIEW: BODY SPACE FITNESS  Iג€™ve wanted to try Body Space Fitness for at least a year? I am loyal to Uplift to a fault, but sometimes a girl gets a wandering eye and knows thereג€™s other strength classes out there. It seems like anyone who tries Body Space Fitness is kind of obsessed with it. Well, I finally tried it yesterday. A friend invited me to go with her, and I will never say no to working out with friends. Let me start this off by saying: I am not in the shape I used to be. (Iג€™m learning to meet myself where Iג€™m at, though.) I was scurred. But the instructor was the badass Ivana Bolf, who I worked with at Uplift, so I was happy for another familiar face. The warmup reminded me a lot of Tone House: butt kicks, high knees, sprints, agility work like grapevines (cariocas? new-to-me word), side shuffling, etc. I was breathless by the end. Uh, this is just the warm-up? Shit. The actual workout was a metcon, programmed as eight stations, with each exercise programmed for a minute (:40 on, :20 rest). The stations yesterday were: TRX one-armed row (I am so weirdly obsessed/fascinated with TRX) Weighted prisoner get-ups Ski erg (also weirdly obsessed with) Jackknife situps Rower  TRX pike (I did a plank instead for my sensitive lower back, and getting your feet in this position is a bitch, also.) Racked kettlebell curtsy lunges (I hate kettlebells with the fire of a thousand suns.) Ab wheel We ended with a five-minute finisher: a ladder of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 kettlebell swings (I did kettlebell good mornings instead for my back) with just as many lateral bounds to rev up that EPOC. When Ivana explained the workout I was all yay! I love all of these exercisesג€¦that changed, oh, 30 seconds in? That said, the workout flew by, and it burned about 460 calories, according to my BFF, Apple Watch.  10/10, would Body Space again (though probably still with a friend, and with an instructor I knew. Iג€™m feeling easily intimidated these daysג€”itג€™s not the space at all, itג€™s me.)
Carefully and Painfully December 27th, 2017 1:59 AM  It's so hard to be a witness sometimes. It's difficult to tell people about Christ and encourage them to believe. Not because I don't want to. I mean, there are times when God tells me to go talk to someone about Him and I'm just like, “Really, God? Right now?” But of course I want to testify and be an example of who a Christian is actually supposed to be, but it's such a delicate process at times.  Believers don't have the greatest reputation. We're made out to obsessive freaks, lunatics who jump up and down and cry and speak gibberish to someone who doesn't even exist (to them). And part of our reputation comes from people who claim to be Christians and do everything a Christian shouldn't. You know, the “Christians”. And then there are the ones who preach and they lecture and they condemn, and they don't show the love they're supposed to. They aren't representing God's love.  We have a terrible reputation, and for the ones who do show love and are gentle and patient, well, we're still grouped up with the others. We're crazy, delusional pricks without an ounce of independence. That's why it's so hard to share faith, because we have to be careful. If we don't, we either offend someone or we scare them away.  So there's a process to it. Some people take an approach like Jehovah Witnesses. Maybe it's a bit scary at first, but it's simple and easy. You go from door to door and you talk to people. They may slam the door in your face or laugh or maybe even argue with you, but the few people who do listen and they start their journey of Christianity are the ones they keep in their lives. They continue to talk to them and teach them things, help and encourage them, and they likely form a friendship. That sounds so easy, and maybe I'm saying that because my method of witnessing can be very painful.  To me this is the most effective way and it's forming a relationship. I don't become friends with people for the sake of converting them. I don't go “Oh! That person's an Atheist, let's be friends with them and show them how to live their life the right way!” No, I become friends with people and form bonds because I love making new friends and sharing life with them. It's because they're cool people and I care about them. Does leading people to Christ encourage me to meet others? Absolutely.  Anyway, I form a relationship with them. I get to know them and they get to know me, we hang out and joke and talk, becoming better friends with them as time goes by. Everyone I know is aware of my beliefs and they normally don't say a lot about it nor do I say a lot about their belief – because you have to be careful – and the closer I am with them, the more I care about them and the more I want them to know Christ. Christianity is not a label or an extra curricular activity, it's a lifestyle. It's hope. It's the certainty of life after death, which is pretty freaking cool.  And because I love people, I want them to know all of this. I want them to know how amazing it is to have a relationship with Jesus, because I know and I wouldn't give Him up for anything. He's given me so much, he gave me a father when I was just a baby. He gave me this wonderful ability and passion to write. He made me look like my dad when we aren't even biologically related. When I'm lonely and I'm crying and I need somebody, he tells me he's there and he loves me. Then he puts people in my life and I constantly think, “God, what did I do to deserve these people? What did I do to deserve your blessings?”  Good grief, I've been through some crap, but he was with me every step of the way. And I want that for my friends. I want them to know that even when everybody disappoints and hurts them, they always have God and he will never fail them. I want them to know that inexplicable feeling of completeness. I want them to have hope and peace. And it hurts because I can't tell them this. I have to be careful or I'll seem pushy and judgmental and rude, but it kills me to watch my friends not know Him. It kills me that they're going on in life without an idea of what they're missing, of who they're missing. I've had friends tell me how terrible they feel. How they feel lost and hopeless and unwanted, and though I tell them I love them and they are wanted, I want to grab their shoulders and say, “Go to Him! Go to God. If you understood. If you knew you would never feel lost again. You would have hope. If you just understood!”  But I have to be careful. I have to ease them into it. I can't be rash or force them into believing. I have to be gentle and patient, and it hurts to see these wonderful people unaware and apathetic. And it hurts even more when I see one of my closest friends try to take his life because he has no joy left. When I see those cuts and the blood and the stitches, I want to go to him and wrap him in a hug. I want to clean his carpet so he can rest without worrying about the stain. I want to tell him that it's okay, that he doesn't have to be lonely. That he has someone who will fill his heart and restore his joy.  I want to tell him all this, but he's sleeping and I don't want to unintentionally push him away. And I just think, what if he succeeded? What if he successfully took his life? He doesn't know Christ. He would only have a certainty of eternal suffering. Eternal sorrow. Eternal hopelessness. I don't want want that for him. He's too precious, too sweet, too great. Much too loved by Christ. He could have it all, but he's sitting in a hospital bed with a limp arm feeling too lonely for words. It's right in front of him, but he doesn't see it. I want to tell him, “Look! It's right here. Your freedom is here, your joy is here, if you would just take it. It's yours and it's free.”  But I have to be careful. I can't push. I can't force.  I can only pray and show him just what it means to be a follower of Christ. I can only slowly introduce it to him as my heart breaks for him.

Food preparation Food and managing food is one of the most important changes I had to make when I decided to get healthier.  Is it easy? No. Is it manageable? offcourseג€¦ Compared to many I have it a little easier because T and me both have the same food, I donג€™t need to make separate meals, we are both ok with repeating food and most days we have very simple meals. Lot of people ask me how I do it and my answer has always been the same 'I plan'. Every Friday or Saturday morning I browse my favorite blogs for recipes for the following week. I usually plan only for Monday to Friday. I narrow down 3 main meals and 2 breakfast options and 2 snack options. I make my grocery list and usually Sunday morning we go grocery shopping. Sunday evenings are my cooking time. I will prepare our snacks, breakfast, sometimes I make stews & soups for the week. I even make the marinades, salad dressings for the week if I can. Then during the week all I do is marinade the meat/fish in the morning before work and bake it once I am back from the gym in the evening while my food is baking I prepare my vegetables, sometimes I bake/grill vegetables in bulk other times I make salads which barely take 10 minutes to prepare. If my planning is done well then you will find me in the kitchen for less than half hour on a weekday not more. Here is a list of things that makes it easier for me My usual breakfast is baked oats with fruit and nuts, I make two different batches for the week. My usual snack options are protein balls and egg muffins again I make about 12 each. I always have Greek yoghurt, apples, oranges and bananas around for snacking. If I donג€™t plan then my food becomes simpler. Sometimes I might not be able to make my food in advance then my snacks change to fruits and carrot sticks. My breakfast changes to cottage cheese with protein nuts and oats. I know which recipe websites work for us so most of my recipes are from the same websites. I donג€™t waste too much time looking for my weekly recipes either, I know what works best for us and thatג€™s what I stick to. I usually try new recipes over the weekend or when I really have more time on my hands. I stick to recipes with similar ingredients: this is just so I am carrying less stuff back from my shopping trip and it's easier to manage. For example if I have sweet potatoes then my week will definitely include sweet potato mash, baked sweet potatoes and sweet potato patty. Finally for  my dessert I also chop and freeze bananas and grapes.  In short: Step 1: find recipes (stick to tried and tested) Step 2: Make grocery list (always keep fruits and carrots around for snacks) Step 3: Shop Step 4: Sunday evenings are for chopping, baking, breakfast and snack preparation Step 5: Every day just do the finishing touches before eating (not more than 30 minutes in the kitchen)  I donג€™t think it can get easier than this or maybe it can but this works for me. The only time you will really see me in the kitchen is on a Sunday evening when I am doing my food prep. I hope you find this post helpful, how do you do your food prep?

Race Report: Bay Vista 5K & 10K Bay Vista 5k & 10K  Location: San Mateo, CA, at Coyote Point Park  Date: Late August (Aug. 22, 2010 this year)  Price: 5K - $35, or $40 on race day. 10K - $40, or $45 on race day.  Deadline: None, as far as I know; you can sign up the morning of the race.  Sellout Factor: As people were still registering last year on the morning of the race, this one probably has a ways to go before it's at risk of selling out. Last year was the first year, though, and I have no idea if the organizers have any sort of cap in mind.  Logistics  Fantastic. Easy parking (it's $5 to enter the park) maybe 100 yards from the start. This, combined with the fact that both courses are loops, made a bag check unnecessary. Since it's such a small race, morning-of packet pickup was super easy. Lots of great sponsors (Sports Basement, Road Runner Sports, Bear Naked, Jamba Juice, Fluid, Clif, Larabars, & more), & tons of free snacks & drinks before & after. Also free sports psychology & chiropractor consultations afterward. I also really appreciated how they worked hard to limit event flyers, use recycled paper for the ones they did make, and didn't give out a big plastic bag full of samples you won't try, coupons you won't use, and flyers for events you won't attend. Instead, you could pickup a reusable bag if you wanted (courtesy of Bear Naked) and grab samples to throw in it as you wanted. Finally, this was the first race I've done where the results were posted at the race site within a few minutes of the event wrapping up.  The Course  Except for one reasonably sized hill (conveniently located near the end), both courses are basically flat and follow the Bay Trail south past the marina and Coyote Point Yacht Club. Running through the park along the Bay makes for a beautiful course.  I ran the 5K as a tune-up for RNR San Jose and it was awesome. It was my first road 5K in years and I hadn't been doing much speed work at all (and certainly nothing you could call focused 5K training), so I was kind of nervous. I was planning to run somewhere in the ~7:15 range since I really didn't know what I was capable of at all at that point & figured that was probably safe. I was only wearing a regular stopwatch, though, & when we hit the first mile marker, I nearly choked when I saw that it read 6:40! "Oh, this is not good," I was immediately thinking, "NOT good AT ALL." It was possible that I was faster than I thought, but not THAT much faster.  At that point, my strategy became simply to hold on & run as hard as I could for as long as I could. I passed several struggling women in mile 2 who had clearly gone out too fast in an even more egregious manner than I had & latched on to a middle-aged dude who I thought was going a pace I could match (at least for a while). Glad I did because we were far enough out in front at that point that he was the only person I could see, & I nearly turned the wrong way until he shouted "NO, THIS WAY!" at me. "ACK!" I squealed, nearly running into him.  In mile 3, I wanted to die. I hadn't checked my watch at mile 2 so I had no idea how fast I was running, but I knew that letting up with less than a mile left would've been a shameful, shameful thing. There was a small but quite steep hill near the end of the third mile, and it was at that point that I *actually* thought I might die & the middle-aged dude pulled away from me & sprinted to the finish. With probably ~.1 mile left to go, I also sprinted to the finish, by which I mean I hurled my body desperately toward it & hoped that my feet would more or less stay underneath me.  I felt worse after that race than I think I have after any other since high school. Even a few minutes after finishing, I was not sure I would live. I was panting for breath & stumbling around like a drunk person, pouring myself cup after cup of water from the orange jug in the finisher area & attempting to get it into my mouth & mostly missing. I think the volunteers there were actually concerned for my safety.  I am pleased to say that I came in first in my age group and second overall with a time of 22:00 flat (7:05 / mile pace). I was more sore in the days that followed that race than I've been after any other I can remember, but I still had a great time & was glad I did it.  Goodies  Bay Vista Tech ShirtOne of the draws of this race is definitely the technical shirt from Greenlight Apparel (made from 100% recycled materials!). It's a lovely shirt & I run in it all the time. Also, instead of a medal, finishers get a stainless steel water bottle (which I find infinitely more useful), & framed certificates were awarded to age group winners three deep by decade.  This race was just a ton of low-key fun. I'd totally do it again. :)
Cantacastello At the weekend we visited a nearby village, San Mariano to attend 'Cantacastello', (singing in the castle) an open air play set around the streets of the village.  We were guided around the streets which were lit by hundreds of candles in glass jars as musicians played and actors dressed in medieval costume acted out various scenes.  There was such a magical and romantic atmosphere and it really felt like we had stepped back in time.  The grand finale of the show was a sword fight by the walls of the castle.  Just 2 more sleeps until we leave for Scotland! We'll be gone for 2 months but I have great intentions of posting regularly while we're away. We'll see!  Lots of love,  Sarah Elizabeth  X

100? Wow! Bonjour beauties! So, this is my 100th post :O Wow. Who knew I could even find that many things to post about! I just want to start by saying thank you to all my followers, old and new. I'm still suprised that people are still interested in what I have to say, but my god am I happy :D I feel like blogger is a place I can come and just release any stress and whatevs... I love being a blogger and I think this will carry on for a while yet!!  100 is a 'milestone' I guess? And I wanted to do a post that's a little bit different. I thought I'd show you the gurus that made me want to blog. It all started when I was browsing videos on youtube of 'prom hair styles' and it just escalated - I began subscribing to people and then onto venturing into the world of blogger! And I thought 'hmm maybe I'm not confident enough to go on youtube, but I'd like to try out this whole blogging thing' and voila... here I am!  With no further adue, here are my favourite youtube guru's. Go and check them all out if you're not already following (which I'm pretty sure you will be). Sam @ http://www.youtube.com/user/beautycrush Samantha is a UK beauty guru on youtube, and is so incredibly gorgeous! I really like the fact she uses a lot of drugstore products, as it makes it more accessible and cheap for people... and helping them to realise that gorgeous looks can be created on a budget.  Libby @ http://www.youtube.com/user/DarlingLibby Libby is pretty new to youtube, and she also has a blog here (pretty sure there's a link on her channel). I love her make-up style, it's actually very similar to my own... soft and subtle, pretty looks! I'm so envious she is beaaaaautiful and I love her accent! Hehe. Gemma @ http://www.youtube.com/user/gemsmaquillage Gemma is another UK based youtube guru, and her channel ranges from beauty and vlogs. I seriously cannot watch one of her videos without laughing, she's so funny and I love to watch video's that make me laugh. She was living in France, and now Spain and it's really interested to see how it's going and things she experiences. Gregory @ http://www.youtube.com/user/GregoryGORGEOUS Greg is actually from Canada, and I love that he plays around with make up. He wears looks that I wouldn't dream of wearing but they're so stunning! His skin is absolutely flawless and he has a real talent for make-up! He also cracks me up so much! Kandee @ http://www.youtube.com/user/kandeejohnson Kandee's videos are so inspirational, whenever I watch them I instantly feel happy! She has such a good way at looking at life. I love that she has so many make up tips and tricks, that truely work. She has so many video's on a bunch of different things. You can find anything over on her channel!  Kelly @ http://www.youtube.com/user/kelanjo19 Kelly is another one whose videos are so inspirational. They range from beauty, fashion, weight loss and vlogs. Her weight loss videos really help me out because she goes through the same struggles as everyone else and doesn't hide it. Everything she says is just so funny - I love watching her videos so, so, so much!  Laura @ http://www.youtube.com/user/lollipop26 Everyone knows Laura! She is so truthful in what she thinks about products, and I think that's so important. I feel like I can always trust her judgement on a product, or listen to a reccomendation and not be dissapointed. She is absolutely gorgeous. One of the first guru's I ever subscribed to! Deffinitely someone to have on your subscriptions list :)  Leina @ http://www.youtube.com/user/MakeupByLeinaBaaaby Leina is stunning and she has a real knack for make up. Some of her looks are really bright and look SO pretty, and some are everyday basics that everyone should no - they're really helpful. She also has an awesome taste in music, haha!  There are literally a tonne more, but I didn't want to bore you all to death! Who are your favourite youtube guru's? What made you want to start blogging? :) Natalieslovex 
Horrid hospitals I had just written a long post about my horrific hospital stay but writing and thinking about the hospital made me angry so I cancelled it. Angry because I don't want to remember or think about the incompetent doctors and nurses. Let's just say that after 17 days in hospital I saw my new born daughter a total of 4 times. In order to see her I had to cry, yell and demand that someone call the maternal nurses and request they bring her down. Their excuse was always the same, they were too busy to bring her down. Too busy to let a person who almost died in a near fatal accident see her own flesh and blood. And they weren't busy since friends and family who were able to view bella bambina through the window reported that countless times they saw nurses sitting down watching tv. When they did bring her down the longest visit was 10 minutes the other visits a whole 2 minutes. I asked if I could feed her, no. I asked if she could stay longer, no. I asked basic information about her such as how much she weighed and they didn't know and never bothered to find out this information for me. I am not saying that the entire public hospital in Cosenza is bad. I had already spent 10 days here when bel bambino was born. It wasn't the best start after they put my on a make shift bed in the gynaecology ward in a room with a pregnant girl who smoked copiously in the bathroom...but after 1 day I was transferred onto the maternity ward which was painted in eye pleasing pastel shades. I was not in the maternity ward this time, I was on the orthopaedic ward which is renowned as the worse ward in the hospital. Sponge baths for bed ridden patients don't exist. If you can't sit up to eat or drink then no one will help cut your food of pass you something. In this hospital (I cannot talk about other Italian hospitals) each patient is meant to have a relative who stays with them 24-7. The relative is meant to clean your body if you have the urge to be clean, the relative has to help you eat, open and close the windows for you, turn on or off your fan (since my room had no air conditioning and bel marito had to bring me a fan from home.) I learnt how to close my drip since no one comes and checks if your drip has finished, no one answers the bell when you call them numerous times. None of the nurses have the ability to clean you properly, none of the doctors answer your questions or can tell you when you are going home. Opps..I'm getting angry again so let's get back to bel bambino. He was in the intensive care ward until Monday morning, a week after the accident. I had seen him 3 times in 4 days as the nurses there were more understanding and knew that I had to see him as much as he had to see me. He was out of danger and on Monday I said good bye to my 2 men. Bel bambino was being transferred to a hospital in Catanzaro. They were said to have excellent doctors who could asses his double fractured jaw. Bel marito told me that the public hospital was like a hotel. Bel marito had a bathroom in their room (my room had no bathroom) he had air conditioning (I had none) he was given a bed to sleep on and I think he was even fed! Bel bambino was constantly being checked, the nurses and doctors all bought him toys and clothes, even packets of nappies. It was very hard for me to be away from bel marito, bel bambino and bella bambina though. I spent the nights alone much to the anger of the nurses. If bel marito could not be with me then I didn't want his mother or someone else to stay. I wanted to be alone even if that annoyed the nurses since I had to call them to assist me. The week passed slowly and on Friday bel marito and bel bambino came back to my hospital to have his leg checked out before going home. By now we had been in hospital for 12 days. The doctor checked his leg and then told us that bel bambino couldn't go home and was to be readmitted into hospital! The same doctor who had told us that after the Catanzaro hospital he could go home...The doctor who changes his mind every day. Thankfully, much to the distress of the nasty nurses on the orthopaedic ward, bel bambino was transferred into my room rather then taken to the paediatric ward. The nurses expressed their anger by offering us no assistance what so ever. Bel bambino was picking at  his scabs so I asked the nurses for a bandage or something to cover his thigh and they told us it was our responsibility as his parents to make him not pick his leg. Each time the nurses came in to give me an injection of a new drip he would cry. Naturally he was scared of strange people doing things to his mummy. When time came to change me they made bel marito leave the room. I asked them if bel marito could stay since bel bambino had become attached to his dad and cried when he was out of his sight but they forced him out of the room. Bel bambino was left crying and screaming on his bed all alone since my husband couldn't see me part naked according to them... (After this episode we argued and got him to stay in the room from then on.) Bel bambino never had his wounds treated, was rarely checked by the doctor, was never given attention or consideration. Nothing. The anger is coming back so let me stop now, I won't pain you with the intimate details of my experience. At least now I am home, bed ridden with nuts and bolts everywhere...oh but that is just going to move me onto the next chapter! Public home help. Stay tuned.
how Lucky I Am To Be A Baby Boomer - Pause to Reflect  With the events of the last week, I think it is time to take a moment to reflect  on how attitudes and rhetoric have changed in my lifetime.  The basic fundamentals that I was taught of respect, compassion and kindness to my fellow man seem to have gotten lost.  My parents were not particuarly religious but as far back as I can remember we got dressed up every Sunday morning for church.  I don't think they attended a church before and once I turned sixteen they stopped taking us.  As dysfunctional as my family was my parents did a great job of teaching us to respect the beliefs of others.  My Mom was a great reader and paraded us to the library every week.  When she went to work books were her method of keeping us out of trouble while she was gone.  The Library in Muskogee was a magical place with its endless series of beautiful wood bookcases, a little merry-go-round and a mezzaine floor of glass blocks.  There was an unforgettable smell of polished wood and slightly musty paper when you walked in the door. There was a whole world to explore in those books we carried home each week.  I think I was about ten or eleven when I discovered a shelf of about twenty or thirty books, each on a different religion of the world.  Funny how I can still visiualize that shelf in my mind as if I was looking at it today. That shelf was my summer reading program and I read them all. Many of them were on the different branches of Christianity but there were also books on Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism.  That was the time I realized that even though they had different names the basic thesis was that they were basically the same.  Man has an inherent need to believe in a higher power.  Each religion has similar rules to live by teaching forgiveness, compassion, kindness and respect for not only our fellow man but for all the animals and the planet we live on.  Sure, we have had a lot of religious wars through out our history probably caused by small groups with fanatical reasons. Every religion of the world has gone through it's time of fanatical beliefs and perhaps every religion you don't believe in looks fanatical from your point of view.  When my parents left it up to me to attend church I began going to different churches with my friends.  There were ones I didn't like too well but growing up in the Episcopal church I was used to a little pomp  and circumstance.  At college my best friend wanted to go to synague on Friday nights and wanted someone to go with her.  She and I took Hebrew classes from the rabbi to understand the service.  Luckily I took Latin in high school which helped with the beautiful midnight Christmas masses at the Catholic church.  Friends of every religion have been apart of my life and I respect all their beliefs even though they may differ from mine.  I only had one relative in Muskogee, an amazing uncle by marriage.  He was well into his late fifties or sixties at my first remembrance of him.  He was a newspaper reporter with fascinating stories about my Dad in Kansas City during the 1920's - not ones Dad wanted told.  Uncle Tom could read seven languages, composed music, painted and read everything printed on paper. He lived in a little house by the railroad tracks I referred to as Uncle Tom's cabin and walked to work as he never owned a car. He never cared about worldly possessions and was an atheist.  Kindness, compassion and a love of learning were his attributes.  Our country was founded on the basis of religious freedom. That is the right to believe in a God or not believe in a God. Our founders were not all Christians, contrary to popular belief and gave us the right to choose our religion.  Our Statute of Liberty says "give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free".  This is what America should be, what we need to be.  In this time of un-Christian rhetoric and hate it is time to pause and think why should we be afraid of letting people in great need come to our country.  The two phrases my parents used a lot keep coming to mind.  "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."   and  "There but for the grace of God, go I"
I'm BACK, baby!!! My trusted and busted Pearl Izumi's A day of rest fixed me right up and I felt good enough to get back in the gym today. In my head, all I could hear was my own personal soundtrack 'Back in the Saddle Again' sung personally to me by Aerosmith. (Gah, wouldn't that be a dream come true? Confession: I had a huge crush on Steven Tyler when I was a teenager, which yes, was ages ago. It didn't matter that he was old enough to be my Dad. He was hot!) So, upon reflection of my last visit and it's affect on my back I remembered I'd pushed up the resistance during my time on the stationary bike in the last 5 minutes. Armed with that knowledge, I made sure to stay a bit more aware during those last five minutes on the bike, made some minor adjustments to my posture and how I was pushing my weight through my legs to the pedals. (Another confession, I'm an awful pronator with my feet so pushing my weight through the center of my feet can be challenging. As if any of you wanted to know that. :D) I kept my pace slightly lower on the treadmill and I finished with flying colors. It feels really great to be able to make a recovery with that and not end up in a bad position where I couldn't work out again without an osteopath's assistance.  And, despite my love affair with my trusted and busted Pearl Izumi's, I'm on the hunt for a new pair of trainers. Do you have a favorite brand that you find you go back to over and over? And did you ever have a secret crush on a musician, rock and roll icon, etc etc when you were a teenager? I'd love to hear who yours was. Ciao, xoxo
A Dali Watercolour Story  THE WOLF PRINCESS A Fairytale Inspired by the Sculptures & Watercolours of Salvador Dali ≈       As she ventured inside the dense and dangerous cloud forests of Accalia, Princess Ylva felt unusually safe and protected. Her loyal wolf companion, Felan was especially alert and energetic, and it was as if nothing could harm them. They travelled by Unicorn; and as she whistled for the flying beast to depart, Felan nuzzled her leg reassuringly. A heavy mist rose and the ice-beetles drunk up the beads of moisture from the dripping fog which softened the leaves. The satin she wore brushed against the wet ferns, and the base of her gown made a constant rustling sound as she glided through the iridescent violets that sparkled on the forest floor. The humid air nourished the bright orange creeping orchids with their blue tongues, as a myriad of rhododendrons soaked up the diffused light. Damp moss and lichen clung to rocks and branches; and the forest’s choir of insects and animals, including a chorus of chattering monkeys, melodious birds, croaking frogs and hissing beetles exploded into song. The tree boa snakes, skinks, geckos, panther chameleons and red owls slept or kept a quiet watch.     Princess Ylva was making her way to the Forbidden City of Kifalu which lay just beyond the forest. Her grandfather, an old broken angel with frail wings, was dying. Although it was his time to go, he made her promise that she would find happiness before he shut his eyes for the last time. He wanted to see her shine, the way he knew she could, long before he fell into complete darkness. This, and only this, would bring the old man who had nurtured her from the age of five peace.     The gates of Kifalu were guarded by a ferocious armoured Rhinoceros with long giraffe-like legs named Diceros. His strong back bore the weight of several golden sea urchins which acted as sensors and alerted him to the presence of any new threat. Diceros’s grief was palpable. His body looked like the casing of a metal house that had survived a great, raging fire. He was possessed with an uncontrollable passion for something; and it consumed him. Princess Ylva could almost smell the soot and charcoal that must inevitably hang on to the insides of his organs. Despite her sheltered life amidst bowing servants in a shimmering glass palace high up on Lunar Mountain, Princess Ylva and Diceros were kindred spirits. There was a cool pool of emptiness inside the Princess, just as her dying grandfather sensed; and Diceros’s fire intrigued her. She loved Diceros and visited him often.     She told the fierce guard all about her bizarre travels, silly wishes, and strange daydreams; and they would sit and talk for hours as they watched planet after planet set in the sky; and moon after moon rise and waver - aquamarine, rose and emerald-coloured - high up above their heads. Sometimes, Diceros played her ocean lullabies from his urchin shells, their massive sound waves crashing and retreating inside her mind. It made her whole being resonate with the rhythm of water. She, in turn, brought him little seedlings, silver flowers, and freshly picked berries from the forest. Diceros would simply scoff and push them away with the tip of his hoof; but the Princess knew he secretly hoarded her whimsical gifts. She would spy bits of crumpled forest left-overs sticking out from under his belly armour the next day; and it made her glow with private joy.     Princess Ylva greeted her old friend. “You must let me through the gates today, Diceros. I must visit the Goddess Oracle. The Old Angel demands it. We have his permission. Here, read this scroll.” Felan howled at a skulking blue moon beyond the horizon on the other side of the gates.     Diceros knew this day would come and his heart sunk, for he knew what lay concealed behind the city’s gates – charming princes and learnt gentlemen; sophisticated elephants with pyramids of diamonds on their backs; riches beyond her wildest imagination and so much more than he could ever offer his Princess. At least that was what he heard from those who returned. Could they be lying? Perhaps it was different for every visitor.     “As you wish, my Princess.”     She didn’t expect the gates to part so quickly. The early light dazzled her eyes for a moment as Felan pounced forward into the unknown.     ‘Goodbye, dear Diceros, I will be back soon!” And just like that, Princess Ylva disappeared into the Forbidden City of Kifalu. ≈     Kifalu was forbidden because it held magic behind its walls. The Angel King granted access only to those who were ready to behold its power responsibly. He could no longer watch his granddaughter search needlessly for something that she already had. Her sense of adventure gave her great courage and vivacity. Yet, it was stillness and grace that she lacked. She stumbled through life with that canine of hers, never pausing for long enough to realise her own self. Diceros and the Angel King knew who she was, but the young Princess Ylva was blind to her own gifts.      The first thing the Princess noticed was the bareness. Tumbleweed was everywhere she looked, spinning and swirling with the wind. Clouds of coral dust hovered in the atmosphere up to her knees, and it was difficult for her to see her feet or the wolf. The landscape was absolutely barren.     “Felan, how am I going to find the Goddess Oracle in here!?”      After a long silence, the wolf made a strange sound, almost like a whimper, and took off in a north-westerly direction.  Princess Ylva pulled her long gown up around her ankles and ran after him. They travelled for just over an hour, but it felt like an eternity. Sweat dripped down the Princess’s face as Felan’s panting grew heavier by the minute.     Princess Ylva took the crystal-encrusted water flask out of her duffle bag and the two of them appeased their thirst. After a few more steps her feet felt an unevenness below them. She bent down into the dust and felt the ground with her hands. They were large pieces of laid stone, one after the other. It was some kind of paved road.      “Come on, Felan, perhaps this will lead us to the Oracle!”      After another hour of walking the dust began to clear. Eventually, the Princess came to the end of the pathway. There, in front of their eyes, sat a delicately manicured garden with perfectly symmetrical, square hedges; and a lemon grove flourishing inside. Its leaves emanated a delicious, bitter scent which instantly permeated the air and seeped into the Princess’s long black hair. The fruits seemed especially bright-fleshed and fresh. They were unlike any lemons she had ever come across before.      As she followed the curve of the garden’s twists and turns, she came to a tall stone statue. It was the only statue in the entire garden. A garden created in the middle of nowhere, in what appeared to be nothing more than a dry, unforgiving desert. The statue was classically draped in cloth and carved out of a pale blue opalescent stone. Felan circled it excitedly.      Suddenly, the sky opened and a downpour began. Loud thunder claps exploded in the distance and bolts of lightning electrified the horizon. Princess Ylva and the wolf took shelter under a lemon tree in front of the statue. As they waited for the storm to subside, they noticed a shape in front of them move.      “Felan, look! The statue!”      The princess could hardly believe what she was seeing. The statue’s eyes were furtive at first. Then she fixed her gaze onto the Princess and spoke.      “Look inside my drawers and you shall find what you seek, Princess Ylva.” Her voice was deep and it echoed and reverberated across the grove for seconds afterwards.      Whilst she spoke, her breasts, belly and left knee turned to antique gold and began to open out. The golden, secret drawers of the Goddess Oracle were revealing themselves to her, and Princess Ylva, hot, wet, exhausted and hungry, began to cry. A great feeling of humility overcame her as she stepped towards the statue and placed her hands inside each drawer. From the left breast drawer, she found a beautiful gold and garnet ring. “This ring was your mother’s. Wear it always and remember who she was, this way you will never feel alone.”      From the right breast, she found a bow and arrow. “This weapon was your father’s. Keep it on your shoulders wherever you go, and no harm shall come to you. “      From the knee drawer came a key. “This key opens the heart of the one you must love, cherish it and never lose sight of it.”      From the belly drawer came a map. “Find the Hibiscus Tree, and there you shall rest and wait. Soon the soul whose heart you must open will meet you at this place and present you with a small flower. Now go and be at one with all that is, my Princess.”  ≈       Princess Ylva felt transformed as she journeyed back to the gates that would lead her out of the forbidden city forever. Her father’s bow and arrow was strapped on to her back and shoulders, and her mother’s garnet ring shone like fire on her finger. She had placed the key inside a breast pocket, close to her heart, and now she began to unfold the old, wrinkled map. Where was this magical Hibiscus Tree? How far would she have to travel by Unicorn before she would reach it? What kind of land would such a tree thrive in?       As she perused it, she began to make sense of where this tree might live. Yet, this could not be right. She rubbed her eyes and checked again, reading the map more carefully this time. Yes, it was an unquestionable fact. This tree grew in her grandfather’s garden, just behind the glass palace, in the valley behind Lunar Mountain. She hardly spent any time there at all for she was far too busy flying off to discover the boundless wonders far beyond the palace grounds.      At that moment, Diceros flung open the gates and she ran to him with a volition of emotion she did not recognise. After some time, the Princess and her wolf companion whistled for the Unicorn. There was no time to linger in the cloud forest; they would travel above the mist straight home to the palace.      “Wait for me, Diceros, I will return tonight, and we can watch the stars shoot and fall like we always do.” Diceros nodded. His dirty grey rhinoceros horn caught a glint of dusk as it dropped past the walls. Yet, he was not so sure that he would see his Princess tonight. What if this mysterious prince with the locked heart appeared with a flower?  No, he was not so sure that she would return to him at all.      By the time the Unicorn drew in its wings and dove down the sides of Lunar Mountain’s deep valley, Princess Ylva was sleepy. She staggered to the Hibiscus Tree which was situated right in the middle of the garden. There, under its large trunk, and using the wolf’s belly as a pillow, she fell into a deep slumber. It was not long before she began to have the strangest dream. A thin, sinewy figure, as tall as a giraffe and as dark and flaky as charcoal, appeared under the Hibiscus Tree and presented her with a flower. This being scared her and she hesitated to take the flower from it.     “You know me well.” It said. “Heal me, pay me attention, bring me light, and all will be as it should be. Do not be afraid.”     Princess Ylva stared at the blackened shadow for a long time, and finally, in an incomprehensible daze, and with one trance-like motion, she took out the key from her dress’s breast pocket and searched for the creature’s heart. A light began to glow in the cavity that must have been its chest, and she could just make out a small key hole hidden under a hollow rib. She pushed the key inside and turned it. A clicking sound was heard and golden light burst forth into her grandfather’s garden sky like fireworks; and when she lowered her gaze to find it again, she discovered that the shadow had vanished completely.     She woke up startled. What did this dream symbolise? As she sat up, she noticed an aching pain in her left breast. It was her heart. She looked down to find a drawer protruding from her chest with the key still inside its keyhole; and there, lying on the grass beside her was the flower from the dream. She panicked and pulled out the key. The drawer shut itself and disappeared into her body, just as if she had imagined the whole thing. She looked at the key in her hand with wonder. Suddenly, it all became quite clear to her. She picked up the flower and ran to the Angel King’s bedside.     “Oh Grandfather, it’s myself I must forgive, it’s myself I must love.”     “Yes, my darling child, your mother and father may have left you the day the swamp swallowed them whole, but they are with you still. You must let yourself be happy, you have no choice. For, there is no prince or wealth in existence that can replace the riches that you yourself must nourish within the soils of your own soul.”     “I understand, grandfather.” Princess Ylva placed the flower on the Angel King’s chest and kissed his cheeks. Her grandfather touched her glowing face and with that last act, slipped away to a place where his wings would once again grow strong. Peaceful at last, his spirit sailed up to heaven in a whisper as his granddaughter’s tears fell onto the sheets like delicate dew drops.     Meanwhile, by the gates of Kifalu, Diceros waited for his Princess to return. Many stars had already fallen, but he would wait forever. THE END
Matters of life and death Last night I settled down with a plate of food and unpaused Come Dine With Me only to realise it was an episode I'd seen before, so was channel hopping a few minutes past the hour and tried one of the true crime channels I enjoy where a Couples Who Kill had just started. I read the mini blurb on the EPG, nope, didn't sound familiar... though by coincidence the man's name was the same as my penfriend's. Some of you already know where this is going, others may guess. Yes, despite never asking, never having been told and resisting every urge to check it out on line (because I felt I would then be communicating with the perpetrator of a crime rather than a person) clearly fate felt it was time I knew why Kostas was on Death Row...And now I do. What is there to be grateful for in this? Hmm, well for one thing it launched an interesting chat or two, including a touchingly perceptive comment from Bob on how I must have felt. I enjoyed those... Someone also asked me why I'd joined Human Writes and it was good to revisit that, especially in the light of new knowledge. (Simple...I was at home alone waiting to die. I went out and bought a Big Issue and there was an advert for people to befriend prisoners facing death alone. It seemed to be the one job for which I was qualified.) You probably know by now I can find at least four sides to every coin*... Crime and punishment? How long have you got? Killing's wrong, right? But is all killing equally wrong? What about to put someone out of their suffering? What if you made them suffer? What about if they're not suffering now but they will do if you don't...or it's to save someone else's life? What if they really want to die and can't do it themselves(Tony Nicklinson)? What if they've killed people themselves and they really want to die (Ian Brady)? What if it's your job - you're an executioner or work in an assisted dying facility? What about a bodyguard? Policeman? Soldier? Soldier fighting on the other side? OK, so you've decided which sorts of killings count...now what are you going to do? Are you going to kill the killers? How? When? Where? What will you do to them if not? Is it kinder to kill them than to lock them up or vice versa? Who benefits? Who doesn't? To some, I know, it all seems very simple and clear but for many of us the moral maze has high and thorny hedges on its convoluted twists and turns. I considered some of the possible scenarios when I signed up to be a penfriend...including that they might protest their innocence...and that that might actually be true! I have issues with the notion of 'just deserts'.For the defining of a person by their deeds. Find me a care home kid who doesn't! But it's one thing to have issues and ideals and another to live by them. I'm grateful for the chance to try. There have been many people left my life because they didn't feel I came up to scratch in some way, failed to please, failed to fit the nice box they'd made for me. There have been a few who have pretended to be friends for some rather unfriendly purpose of their own. Human Writes is not a dating agency. You don't look at snaps and rap sheets and choose your con...someone is assigned to you and I've always given thanks that Kostas is articulate and intelligent, interesting and encouraging to me in my struggles with ill health. His crimes could have been something I would have found much harder to deal with so I'm grateful for that. Changing the subject somewhat I came home yesterday afternoon to find this on the stairs...I know it's a bit of a rough neighbourhood but even so I'm glad it only belongs to a pre-school pirate! Today I have to go out in the pouring rain for a mammogram. There should be a law against that surely? I'm grateful the unit is parked not far away and that it only happens every few years. The mammograms not the rain! *(inside, outside, front and back!)
Follow your Light  The very end of October and very beginning of November is my favorite holiday time. So full of mystery, magic and hope. This time of year is steeped full of traditions, history, honoring our Ancestors and all of those that have come before us and of course, focusing on our own personal responsibility and Spirituality. How could anyone not be enamored with this week of the year?!!  In just 5 days you have Halloween, New Years, Samhain, Dia de Muertos, All Saints' Day, All Souls' Day, Diwali, and New Years [again]! And, those are just the ones I listed off the top of my head. (If you have anything that you celebrate that I've missed, please contact me here so that I can include them next year.)  Here's your homework:  Find a new holiday to learn about. Pick something between October 31st-November 4th. And, with the Internet, this should be a snap. Make sure you choose something that resonates with you, your current belief system and that can fit nicely into your already planned celebrations.  1. Read about the history of the holiday you picked. Be sure to search more than one website and/or go to the library and check out a few books, stories and even craft and cookbooks.  2. Experiment with some of the rituals [on that holiday's date]. This can be anything from setting up an alter, letting candles burn throughout the night or even meditating, singing and dancing ~ it's whatever tickles your fancy.   3. Craft something; you can make a wreath, mask or a doll, light a row of candles, make a dish from/for that holiday, or even make your own New Year's list. You must CRAFT it. The crafting is important because it's you getting physically involved in what you've just learned about. (You may already have something planned for the ritual of that day.) This section of your homework is about you letting your creativity flow! Enjoy the Holidays!!!  4. Document and journal your effort, experience and rituals. Take pictures of what you did and write about it in your journal. Don't have a journal? No problem! Go get one. Journals and notebooks are everywhere. Find one that fits who you are or, more appropriately, who you want to be. (Still not sure where you should look? Try this online store In the Section Products that Inspire.)  So, why don't I just explain and teach you about all of the holidays mentioned above [here]? Well, for one thing I just listed at least 8 different religious celebrations, and to be quite honest, there are bound to be multitude of people who are offended and complain about what I'd write. How do I know? Because I get that all the time.  (If you'd like more information, Living Lightly Newsletter is sending out a variety of holiday emails that explain a few of the holidays and give you ideas and exercises to do at home. You can sign up for those here.)  But more importantly... I want you to listen to your intuition and find what resonates with you. That's what makes learning about yourself and Spirit fun. That's what makes it exciting. It's not the force feeding that teaches and inspires you, it's the inner promptings. It's the learning to pay attention to yourself and the training to notice your inner thoughts and feelings. It's the amazing ways that Spirit works through you and brings you the guidance and messages that you crave. It's all the synchronicities and the coincidences that happen so frequently that a coincidence just doesn't mean the same thing anymore. It simply, means much, much more than it ever has before.  Yes, I write this blog to teach you. Yes, I give you 'real' information. But nothing, no thing and no person can ever replace that Ah-Ha moment when you get something yourself or when your whole world makes sense or when you sit back and watch everything in your life fall into place. That is magic. That is Divine. That is what I strive to help you uncover in your life. It's already happening all of the time within and around you... My job, well, my job is to help you tune into the subtleties so that you see it, feel it, know it and move with it, every moment of everyday.

Speech from NOWSA 2010 Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge the owners of the land we are meeting on, the Pambalong people. This is stolen land whose sovereignty was never ceded, and I pay my respects to their elders past, present, and future, and to any Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today. I’d also like to thank the organisers for giving me the opportunity to speak today. It’s a real honour to have been asked and I hope what I have to say is valuable to you. Just a little about myself, before I start. I’m studying at Sydney University, where I’m involved in the postgraduate association, SUPRA. From October 2008 to June 2009 I was sole president, then from July 2009 to June this year I was co-president. I’ve also been involved in feminist and anti-racist organising in Sydney. I’ve been asked to speak about the herstory of the Women of Colour Network to the conference, and how it relates to the themes of intersections and autonomy. I’ll include some personal stories along the way in relating this herstory, and go on to talk about how it relates to other activism that I’ve been involved in. Herstory of the Women of Colour Network The Women of Colour Network was an idea born in the minds of two women in 2007 - myself and a friend who was then University of Melbourne Student Union’s Co-Women’s Officer. I had begun to become interested in radical women of colour politics, and had freshly read This Bridge Called My Back. Meeting another radical woman of colour feminist was incredibly inspiring, and we were in a mood to try to reach for big things. We spoke to the organising collective about having an autonomous space for women of colour, and of establishing an autonomous caucus. Both of these requests were granted, and we eagerly prepared for the caucus, and to establish a network. NOWSA is an intensely political space, and it can be marked by a number of tensions, conflicts, and challenges that aren’t always comfortable to negotiate. Autonomous spaces within the broader NOWSA conference offer a temporary reprieve of some of those tensions, and let us reconfigure them in new ways. I can’t claim to speak for all participants in the caucus, but I certainly felt that the caucus space was the highlight of the conference. Where, in most other spaces, the experiences of women of colour are marginalised, the caucus was driven by the political energy coming from our experiences. It is important to acknowledge that the Women of Colour Caucus came about after NOWSA had gone through a history of racism. In 1989, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women from the First International Indigenous Women’s Conference walked out of the NOWSA conference in Adelaide. In 1999, Aboriginal poet Lisa Bellear was booed when she addressed racial issues in a plenary, and there have been major tensions between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women participating in the NOWSA conference in the past. Lisa Bellear wrote a list of suggested protocols in the Melbourne University Student Union’s publication Judy’s Punch, which was circulated at the 2006 NOWSA conference. Many of these protocols were incorporated by the 2007 organising collective. With this history within Australian feminism, it is important that there is formal recognition of women of colour within feminist organising. Including an autonomous caucus in the NOWSA conference will hopefully ensure a continued space for women of colour to raise our concerns within student feminism. We wanted to create something sustainable for the future as well. The student movement is characterised by constant change and people moving on. You can’t always be there to see your own projects through, so you have to leave strong institutional legacies to make sure that equity is addressed in the movement. Most of the founding members of the Women of Colour Caucus have graduated and moved on. Knowing that the caucus continued last year at NOWSA without the participation of any of the founding members was really inspiring, and I hope that the caucus will continue after we all (eventually) graduate. With the bane of VSU blighting the numbers, the engagement, the energy, and the capacity of our student organisations, we can’t ensure that NOWSA will always be well-populated or that the variety of student feminists will be well-represented. In particular, it seems that funding constraints often mean that only a few women from each campus, at times only Women’s Officers, are able to attend. This tends to disadvantage women of colour, particularly those who can’t take time away from work. Hopefully the continuity of the Women of Colour Caucus will ensure that women of colour have a strong presence and contribution to NOWSA far into the future. Intersections NT Intervention Shortly before the 2007 NOWSA conference, the Northern Territory Intervention was announced. From the earliest days, the rhetoric around the intervention has been about the protection of women and children from domestic violence, issues which have been front and centre in feminist campaigning. Disappointingly, however, feminist organising hasn’t really developed much around the Intervention. Instead, the political right has co-opted feminist language to justify the economic coercion, dispossession and cultural genocide enacted under the Intervention. For instance, the National Plan Of Action to Reduce Violence Against Women and Children, which was called for by many women’s groups, affirms the Intervention as the most appropriate response to domestic violence in Aboriginal communities. Only a few weeks ago, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform and Reinstatement of the Racial Discrimination Act) Bill was passed, which allows the federal government the power to apply income management to any area in the country where it deems it’s necessary. The Intervention has finally been made national, and will disproportionately apply to the most disadvantaged people in the community, predominantly women. In an historical sense, welfare has been a central concern of feminism. Feminists have fought for fairer welfare provisions, for equal access to certain benefits, and for services from the state. At the same time, Aboriginal women particularly have suffered through the social control mechanisms of welfare. The Intervention is clearly an extension of paternalistic forms of welfare, which women of colour the world over have fought against. Although some feminists, and nearly all welfare agencies, have opposed income management, the presence of feminists in the campaign against the Intervention remains patchy. It is time to put an intersectional perspective into action and deploy our feminist politics in standing against this gross injustice. The limited experience I had of truly intersectional organising was working with the Sydney Reclaim the Night collective in 2008, where we made the Intervention the main focus. We highlighted the role of state violence in the Intervention, and the ways that state coercion has been experienced as violence by the people affected by the Intervention. This effect has disproportionately fallen on women, but I now think that we may have underestimated the effect on Aboriginal men. We have to understand that men of colour, too, are implicated in the white paternalism of the Intervention, and feminism has historically been terrible at addressing the oppression experienced by men of colour alongside women of colour. In some cases, de-centring sexism is the most vital thing we can do to fight against oppression of women. International Students This is particularly clear in the rather male-dominated field of education activism. One of the major things I took on in my term(s) of office as president of the Sydney University Postgraduate Representative Association was campaigning for international students’ rights. It was clear to me from the outset that international students are some of the most oppressed students in the student community. Visa restrictions, exploitation in the workplace, abuse by landlords, discrimination in universities, and intimidation were the things I heard from international students on a regular basis about their experiences. The intersection of education, capitalism, race, and class shape these issues. For women international students, the huge but invisible issue seems to be sexual harassment in the workplace. Many of these issues were only addressed in the media last year, after many years of advocacy by international students through their student organisations. Part of the reason for this was that the issue of violence was taken up as a salient point in protests, and part of it was that international media had started to pay attention. As it became clear that many international students are prospective immigrants to Australia, the current of xenophobia in the public discourse about international students became more pronounced. International students were either hapless dupes of unscrupulous immigration and education agents, or they were ‘bad’ immigrants, opportunistically using education to jump the queue, so to speak. Government responses to issues raised by international students has been incredibly contradictory. On the one hand, the regime of allowing onshore applications for permanent residency was initiated by the Howard government in 2001, and now that we are in an election year under a Labor government, the door is being slammed in the faces of thousands of students who have spent thousands of dollars in accessing education, employment and a livelihood in Australia. After a lot of advocacy, the government initiated a range of inquiries. Their solution to the ‘problem’ of international students was to restrict the numbers that come to the country in the first place. The Migration Act Amendment (Visa Capping) Bill 2010 will very likely be heard in parliament in mid-August. This bill gives the Immigration Minister the power to terminate residency applications from any particular class or range of visas, which might mean discrimination on the basis of race or nationality. But we already know that the bill will affect students trained in the least valued occupations - cooking, hairdressing, and community welfare: all gendered as traditionally feminine occupations. I don’t think this is a coincidence. I really encourage you to find out about the convergence on Canberra happening in August when the Bill is read in parliament, and make the effort to come along in support. Intersectional Politics in Action My experience in the campaigns against the Northern Territory Intervention and for international students rights have involved working with people less privileged than me. I’ve learned some hard lessons in these campaigns, which I want to share with you today. Most of these lessons won’t make as much sense outside the context of the particular work being done, but I want to try to articulate what I’ve learned as my contribution to this conference. I also think it’s important to share these reflections because many of you will graduate and then go on to work in service provision, advocacy, or will continue as activists. For the activist community to mature and grow we need to share our lessons more effectively. I was never given much guidance with these issues, so I felt that it would be good to take the opportunity to share my knowledge with others, to reverse that trend. In many ways, intersectionality is a bit of a buzzword in radical politics, but most organising still takes place along single-issue lines. It’s difficult to address multiple oppressions at the same time, especially in activism that’s focused on transforming particular institutions. Working on more than one institution at once is incredibly difficult, and requires a lot of dedication and commitment. Too often, intersectionality has remained a theoretical understanding of domination only, and hasn’t been deployed in feminist praxis. One of the key elements of intersectional politics we need to understand is to act in solidarity with others who may experience oppressions that we don’t. Most often, this solidarity work is called “being an ally”. I think this term, and this way of looking at it, is really problematic. Being an ‘ally’ In all my activist work, seeing myself as an “ally” really limited how effective I could be. The notion of “allies” presupposes that the political self-identification of someone as an “ally” means that the person is being effective, regardless of whether they actually are. It militates against the person being held accountable by the group they are supposedly “allied” with. That lack of accountability is based on privilege; so in many ways, the notion of being an “ally” reinforces privilege. One of the biggest mistakes I made was imposing my own vision of liberation onto a community I was working in solidarity with; and I’ve seen this done time and again by student activists. While you might have a great theoretical understanding of a particular kind of oppression, even one that’s related to the oppression that affects you, only the people experiencing it can determine the appropriate response to it. What’s important to remember about the nature of oppression is that it undermines the autonomy of the people it affects. And opposing oppression means upholding the autonomy of oppressed peoples, even if that autonomy might sometimes mean engaging with the so-called oppressor. Imposing a rigid vision of liberation onto people can be just as oppressive as historical and traditional forms of oppression. Part of ending oppression is creating the space for oppressed peoples to engage with things that have been deployed oppressively on their own terms. It’s also important to remember that not all of the people within an oppressed community will have the same response to their oppression, and there can be some very sensitive tensions within a community around political differences in relation to domination. It’s important to respect those tensions, since they’re often the result of a history that affects a lot of people. You can get drawn into a situation where you’re benefiting from tension and infighting. Those circumstances are always really difficult to negotiate. It was really counter-intuitive for me to understand this, but at times, the best thing you can do in solidarity with a community is to go against the wishes of someone you are working with. That can especially be the case when they’re doing something abusive and unethical. It’s important to get rid of the notion that we sometimes have of people in oppressed communities as helpless victims. This vision erases the agency that oppressed people have, and the real harm they can do to other oppressed people. Part of an intersectional perspective is understanding that oppression and privilege can be contextual, and can work together to benefit or harm certain people. A perspective informed by privilege and guilt can cause you to be harmfully negligent when abuse is happening. And, of course, the key to unpacking this privilege is to begin with how it affects your own community, and may uphold oppressive practices within feminist spaces. Ultimately, there’s no field manual for solidarity work. Your judgement is the only tool you have to make a decision about how to approach a situation. In most instances, you will be held accountable, and you need to be open to being held accountable, for mistakes you make. There is no source of information that can give you all the answers and negate your accountability for your own actions. All we have is the opportunity to learn from others, and the wisdom of our own experiences. On that note, I’d like to leave a question for the conference delegates not participating in the Women of Colour Caucus. I’d like to ask how you think we can better build mechanisms of accountability to women facing a variety of oppressions into feminist organising spaces.
Snack with Purpose! Avoid what Dr. Ian calls "empty calories" - food that serves no purpose to your body.  They don't refuel, they aren't part of a major food group, basically all they do is taste good and add pounds!  Examples include alcohol, candy, cake, etc.  Even when you are eating something purely for pleasure, try to make it a healthy choice that satisfies a healthy requirement from the food pyramid. For example - I was watching NBC's The Biggest Loser and there was blatant advertisment of the new frozen smoothies from Yoplait.  Now I don't mind the advertisement, in fact I discovered a great new food, but I have to admit it is cheesy the way they try to act as if they are having casual conversation and just happen to give ALL of the product details!  lol.  Anyway, these smoothies are an awesome option because it can serve as a snack, beverage, and/or breakfast and also contains a serving of dairy as well as a full serving of fruit!!!! You will have satisfied your sweet tooth, filled up, and eaten fruit all for only 110 calories (snacks should always be less than 200 calories). You can find the smoothie mix in your frozen food aisle - trust me these things are amazing, even kids will love them! Other purposeful snack options would be: regular yogurt or pudding (dairy), baked apples with cinnamon or frozen grapes (fruit), or baby carrots with fat free dip (vegetables).
