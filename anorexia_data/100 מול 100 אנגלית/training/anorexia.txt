My thoughts on today and yesterday Monday (yesterday): I was allowed to take a walk in the garden downstairs. It was nice and warm, but far too short. Better than the boring walks on the unit, I guess. But at least my grandma brought my Guinea pig Lenny. So I held him as a walked. Honestly since they've been increasing my calories and I've gained like 8 lbs I'm depressed all the time. I don't feel like doing anything. I only force myself to go on the walks is for calorie burning purposes even though I know it isn't burning too much extra.  The dietician outdid herself yesterday, my total calorie intake was 2735 fucking calories!  Today: so far 1500 calories consumed, less than yesterday at this time, but still a fuckton. I still have dinner and two snacks left. Dammit I wanna cut so bad, but I have no tools... I'm officially the fat one on the unit. There are two other anorexics that I've seen on my walks, they are both so tiny, me, ugh my bmi is In the 16s. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. My stomach is huge, I can barely see my hipbones and my ribs are a distant dream. I can't do this much longer, I think i will restrict again once I leave the hospital. I hope a volunteer dog comes today, they are the only things that snap me out of my depression, even for a fleeting moment...
Emotions Sometimes I sit on my bed and trace my collar bones and hip bones and remember the time before my life was overcome with the desire to be thin. I Try and remember what it was like to sit down and not have to think about how my thighs squish together. I try to remember what it was like to love the way my body looked without having to be a lower number on the scale each morning. I try to remember what it was like to look down and not worry about if I’ll be able to balance a ruler on my hip bones today or not. I try and remember what it was like not to get up at 5 every morning and run until I can’t breath. I try to remember what it was like when I didn’t do 300 crunches a day in a desperate attempt to get rid of the food I had eaten that day. And I can’t do it. Sometimes I think I can, but all I can remember about the past was how I used to be 125 pounds and I have only been able to drop to 108. It’s all I can think about. I am constantly checking and rechecking to make sure I can still fit my hands around my calfs, my thighs, my wrists, my neck, to make sure I can still feel my collar bones, my hip bones, my spine, my ribs. It’s all I have now. And I don’t remember how to be happy without being thinner. ~Robin ❤
Tips to Workout & Stay Motivated Rise and Shine: Set you alarm clock back an hour every three to four days. By allowing yourself time in the morning, your more likely to workout. 1. your not tiered from your day, 2. You cant make excuses about having a bad day or being tired and 3. you got up specifically to exercises. Plan Plan Plan: Plan your workouts beforehand and set out your workout clothes the night before. Lazy days: Even if you have a lazy day, SO SOMETHING. Do light exercise such as walking, yoga and pilates. Hey, you can even dance along to an fav upbeat song. Scorching Boring: Don’t make it boring, do things you enjoy and dont forget to mix up your exercises/workouts. Remembering your progress: Keep a journal for your workouts.

Motivational Tip: Get a cork board and cover it with pictures of people who have your dream body. Put it where you are going to see it everyday… its a constant reminder for you. – A oxoxox
Stuffs in my life OMFG THE DUMBASS WEEKEND DIETICIAN AT THE HOSPITAL MADE ME EAT 3300 FUCKING CALORIES TODAY. FUCK. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. I want to die so bad. I know I'm still "technically" underweight (bmi 16.7) but all the weight I've gained is in fat so I'm not skinny anymore. Why is it that the more weight I gain the more she makes me eat!!!! Also, random thought, I've never seen a male dietician before. Do they even exist?  I'm 99.99% percent sure I'm gonna relapse when I discharge. I'm not ready to recover, I haven't reached my UGW yet. They didn't let me reach it before I got hospitalized. Oh but I missed food SO MUCH. a gross part of me is glad they're making me eat because it tastes soooooooooooooooo good. If I don't reach my UGW on my next relapse before they hospitalize me I think I'm gonna kill myself. FML.  I'll keep adding entries. Not that anybody cares or is even reading this.
Could I be any worse of a human? Well I'm approaching my 10 year mark of having eating disorders and it's hitting me pretty hard tonight. I'm not sure why it is but, I guess it's because I went out to dinner with my ex that I dated almost 3 years ago at the height of my ed and we got mexican food and 4 hours later when I finally got home I purged? The question mark is because I know that after 4 hours there is absolutely no point in purging so, I don't know why I did? I'm seeing someone I used to really not like (He used to be my exs best friend until they had a huge fight and now hate each other) and he makes me happy and everything has felt like a movie between us its been so good. So, why am I so sad tonight? Why am I back on here after so long? Why do I still want my ed to get worse again? Most importantly why do I think I love him after such a short period of time of only liking him as a person? I leave for grad school in a month and I'm sad, excited, happy, and scared all at the same time. I've looked at pushing my move date back because I don't want to leave him yet. I'm not ready for it to be over yet. I don't want him to move on so quick. Yet, with all of that being said, I'm still just hoping my ed will take over now that I'll be living on my own again and I just want to get back to my LW. How could anyone love someone like me right now? They couldn't. But, deep down I'm begging him to feel the same. I'm begging that he will want to try to keep seeing only me even after I leave. Maybe it's just an infatuation but, right now he's almost all I can think about and it's completely consuming me. These are the parts of me that I hate the most.
﻿anafood: lunch/ dinner ideas! Day 2 of the anafood series! I combined lunch and dinner since they’re easily interchangeable. Keeping them separated so they aren’t messy to read.

Hello Strangers. Hello Lovelies. I am so so sorry I've been gone for so long. Stuff got crazy and I couldn't come back here. I never forgot you. I need to stop pretending that I can 'recover' and that I'm 'happy' in my 'body' because I'm not. I'm fatter than ever because they got worried and I relaxed and now I'm 180lbs. I know how disgusted you are with me, I'm in shock myself. I dusted off my trusty scale after all this time and I'm the heaviest I've ever been. So I'm starting anew. She's back in my head, screaming at the fat hanging from my bones. Crying at the sight of muscles snuggling under a duvet of blubber. She's back and she's stronger than ever. She's the one writing in my diary now, I haven't written anything in weeks. She's back and she's so disappointed in me I can't bear it. Today I ate 776 kcal. Tomorrow I will eat 500 kcal. Please comment me if you want me to follow you/ get back in touch. I've been out of the loop for so long I don't know who's still blogging, who's new, who's good... let me back in the loop :) I've missed you all so much. I've missed her so much. This feels like home, I'm so grateful. Rydw i'n caru ti, Kiki xx

IM GONNA DIE SOON, FUCK... I think I am dying from the eating disorder. I really think I am dying of something. I just turned 28 and had an ED 16 years.  Im not at my lowest weight but have all of the physical symptoms. So bad. My arms cramp and hurt to type this and my vision is blurred. My chest hurts. My ass bones hurts, my knees hurt to touch off one another , my most recent relapse happened sooooooo fast. ....... so fast..... I have been hula hooping for hours and hours and running around eating nothing, taking lax etc ...... One day this week I literally ate HALF a chicken nugget. 40 calories?!!! 5 chicken nuggets is a serving, a serving counts towards one of three meals a day. I know tihs and yet ignore everything. Can I continue to defy the laws of nutrition/ I think not. My kidneys feel fucked up. I will try to get antibiotics tomorrow but seriously just think im gonna die soon...... yeah it will be so sad if i Do.... cause i have been trying... i work as an ESL teacher online and have friends and family..... am a relatively young woman.... i wanted to move to Deutschland, Germany!!!1 back to Frankfurt to work and even settle down and buy an apartment. Build a life. I could end up back in the psych unit again and making a semi recovery. But I always relapse. So unfortunately I am in the statistics...... those awful statistics about EDs that state some die due to the illness or because of suicide and dont get better...... yeah some do get better but I am now in the bracket of the people who are CHRONIC, the people who never reach a recovery.  I am so cold..... the pain in my bones is hard to describe, how to describe it/./???///// i want to SCREAM and cry and rock in the fetal position ..... I want to be cuddled...... i want somebody to stroke my hair and say I will be ok ....... my knees are purple in under these PJS. Thats apparently called Reynauds disease a side effect of Anorexia. My SHIT IS GREEN. Whatever I have eaten this week was pooped out straight away, green ........ im peeing all the time and it hurts my back and stomach and chest ....... i wonder is it ketoacidosis..... if it was i should be in ICU at the moment but I am afraid to go to A and E because Ive been in hospital a lot before and I am ashamed..... at some points I was fit to dial an ambulance but I cant do it ........ for the moment I am staying put, alone, in pain. Who knows maybe the GP will give me ensures tomorrow and they could really help...... if not ...... a few more days and I could just die........ this is so serious........this is so serious and i cant laugh it off anymore...
yesterday i hung out with some old friends from the start of high school, and it just really got me thinking about how i don't know myself. i hang out with my 'current friends' and get blackout drunk every weekend, just the same old shit of pres and listening to music and then town. towards the end of the year i stopped going to pres at like 6pm and started joining at about 9pm so i can sit around with a group of people and drink enough alcohol in half an hour that will get me adequately wasted for the remainder of the night. then, coming to see my old friends, yesterday it was nice to get a pizza and just think about how weird and how long it's been, but my 'old friends' don't hang out without smoking. don't get me wrong, i currently am way more into the idea of weed all the time over alcohol, but i don't know why i can't just do things sober. like, i really have no idea what i'm going to do next year. at the moment, i'm in the mindset of 'i don't give a shit if me being sober means my social life goes down the drain because at least i'm doing good for my physical health and mental wellbeing', but the times in the past when i have tried to stop drinking, that clearly didn't work. it probably means that i just need to find new friends, but i really honestly don't care enough for that. i'm very close with my sisters and my mum, and i am okay with that. it probably makes me sound like a sad loser, but i really just cannot be bothered making the effort to form new friendships right now, or even make old ones better. i just don't really care about it. all that's on my mind currently is how next year, i can just be in full control of my life, my schedule, what i eat, everything. there's no pressure for me to do anything except for pay my rent. i don't think i'm going to make much of an effort next year to do stuff with friends because there's just no point. i'm moving to the states when i graduate anyways, so any lasting friendships i don't believe are gonna come from the next two years. we'll see.
Determination... Still have serious love for "Filter - Skinny" & "Catatonia - Bulimic Beats" & "Edith Backlund - Skinny"! Listen to it beauts! Will begin this by telling you my total fail in life today (in a sort of funny way)… Well..  In my lunch break I was oh-so organised and wrote down everything I planned to write in my blog… And I left it in the staff room…. Total. Fail… If anyone finds it? I’m screwed… Hopefully the cleaner will see it and throw it away :-/ I’m still laughing at it… but sort of in a funny/nervous way… Anyway… The bad news… Put on another frigging 1lb today! But that’s ENTIRELY my fault tbh. Fasted the whole day on Wednesday! So so soo proud of myself as that was my first ever (intentional) fast! Didn’t cave at all! Lived on green tea, black coffee, water and the flavour of my hot chocolate Avon lip balm on my lips :- ) Strange thing is, I expected to go to bed feeling hungry… Only I felt full :-S odd…So that was a good day and I woke up yesterday being 161lb!! Was so proud! ….. Notice ‘was’…. After work, already shattered, had to go up to my Auntie’s house, with mum, to thank her for my Christmas presents (she got me a travel mug which I LOVE, my Banksy diary, and a mug with a cosy on it!! Brilliant!) So when we arrived, she had just plated dinner, with leftovers (“lucky us” were my words exactly)… Spaghetti and meatballs… With parmesan bloody cheese… IN THE FRIGGING SAUCE! So not good, although we walked home (like, 20 minutes walk?) I still put on another 1lb today :-/ My own fault, although I didn’t eat it all obviously, said I was stuffed from my lunch at work (99kcal cup-a-soup)… But then of course, food being my weakness, I caved in an binged all night! What is wrong with me! I literally don’t have any self control… Whatsoever! Ate tons of Ritz crackers, a Chomp bar, and a bloody bowl of soup! As you can imagine my whole family must be over 16st hence the habit of continuos eating even when I’m not even hungry! Which I wasn’t! I was bored! My whole family is huge. Literally. All of them. As was I, and my sister, until she started Slim Fast. But today, I have fasted ALL day because I am determined today. Although walking to and from work (2ish miles) means I only burned roughly 250kcals so far today. Restarting my gym membership tomorrow so that means at least 2 spinning classes a week, plus a steady run there and back = a total of 1000kcals burned per day at least… That’s not too bad… Wish it was more tbh… Will definitely be pushing myself to the extremes once I get my fitness back!  Reading some of your lovely comments, I’ve re-thank/thunk/thinked (what the hell is the right tense????) my theory… Haha… Maybe 're-examined' would be better?... Anyways. I know when I’m fasting that I CANNOT eat. And I wont. And I havent. .. When I know I have a limit, I get home, and can’t help myself.  Hopefully when I get back to the gym I can spend more time there instead of being bored and home and ending the night in more shamless binging/purge sessions…  (Maybe there wasn’t a theory there at all tbh... Haha! I think it was just a realisation….) People at work are asking why I’m eating barely anything on my lunch break (they’re so f-cking nosey!!!) Its so awkward…  Telling them I’m on a diet... (which I tried last year and they know it worked for me -BHF diet if you’re wondering)...so I find it to much effort to bring the meals into work with me…. They’re buying that… For now. - Unfortunately I wrote this out on that goddamn piece of paper!!! I am sooooooooo idiotic at times!!! :-P I like that they worry... (and tell me I don’t need to loose weight- even though they’re lying because they don’t want fatty me to get skinnier than them)...but I wish they wouldn’t. They’re interfering! :-/ But there is a girl at work who is such an amazing friend. And really understands me! She knows a lot about my past etc, and she doesn’t judge at all. Accidentally spilled a bit of this to her :-/ she saw me adding up calories on the calculator xD ahaha! She doesn’t know everything but she knows I’m determined to get to my goal weight by fasting and not eating and she said “well I’ll support you as long as you don’t get ill and start worrying me!” She’s so amazing. But I trust her and I know it wont go further :- ) Its payday tomorrow. So if I drop to 160lbs tonight (which I better had, considering last time I fasted I went from 165 to 161!) then I will buy all my new skinny size 6/8 clothes from work and put away until I fit them. I will hang up the jeans (size 6) in front of my bed so I see them every single morning and wake up motivated :- D I know I said I wouldn’t buy anything, but, c’mon! I work in a clothes shop for Christ’s sake! What do you expect me to buy if I cant buy food? Ahaha… But I get my discount, and got vouchers for Christmas so its not going to be my big spree, just a bit of real life thinspirational for me to see day to day :-) On Tuesday hopefully my iPhone will arrive, so I’ll be able to blog on the move and see all of your wonderful updates and comment more (which I wish I did, because I know I love receiving them and hearing your amazingly kind words!) I always think of things I want to tell you guys, during the day, but the moment I get home, its like, poof :-/ I cant wait for the day I step on the scales and it doesn’t move :-/ that would be such a goddamn impossible dream, but hey, a girl can dream right?! Also, once I get nearer and nearer to my UGW I will start posting ideas of my tattoo designs etc… And my new measurements, and pictures of before and after, etc :-) Not much more to update on though sorry guys! If you haven’t read my last post then, welcome!... But I will be staying at the boyf’s house over the next two days. I will log on before I go to update you on my weight for the morning and how anything else goes between 9am and 3pm :- ) Also on my last post, I posted a thinpso picture of this girl holding a pencil by her side… And she was smaller than it.. That’s another goal for me, one day I will upload my very own version of that picture :-D  Finally, my replies to your comments! - wheniamskinny,I’llbepretty: how did your trip go? Hope you stayed strong, but everybody has off days girl :- ) you cheered me up so much! Thank you!  - stillimagining: I did have soup the next day, but found I didn’t want the food but was starving afterwards! May try fasting for 2 days next week… We’ll see… Thank you girl! - a friend of ana: I know! It’s crazy! 18inches is smaller than my bloody head! Ahaha! But she was such a beautiful woman, I think it’s do-able! Just need a hell of a lot of motivation! It’s a great website, 90% of them are so relatable! Thanks for the comment!  - Tatyana: Thank you again for your kind comments :-) I agree with you about the triggers :-/ I just need a bit more c control and being able to stop myself and say “No. I don’t need this” I felt SOOO unbelievably guilty in bed last night, but the night before, I loved feeling so happy with my control! :-) at least you’ll be able to remember the feeling of you in those jeans, I took a photo in my old size 8 jeans.. Urgh… not a good look. But I know I WILL fit them soon enough! We can both do it girly! :-) Hope you’re all keeping well, thank you again fro all of your amazing comments and lovely thoughts :-) stay strong and think thin :-) Food is a bitch, don’t let her win :-) her legs are incredible!!! i know i hate her, but DAYM! She had an incredible body. ( went a bit mad on the thinspo guys... Soz :-P ) Xxx
"Once A Week" ... this is what I've told myself about my weight. That I'm going to 'weigh-in' - once a week, on a Saturday morning. Now, what this doesn't mean is that I'm only stepping on the scale 'once a week'. What this does mean is that I will only record weight as progress once a week on a Saturday morning. Along with my waist and hip measurements. I will of course weigh in every day, because fucked if I can stop myself. It's like that ritual... that thing we do (to quote eat, pray, love) to know how much self-loathing to take into the shower.  I am trying to let myself eat more, but it doesn't always happen. The good news is that it has been around 1200 cals, which is okay. According to the numbers, I should lose at least 1lb a week. I will get there.  It's been a few of good days. It has been a weekend of good days. I had 1200 on Friday through till yesterday. According to my app, that means I will weigh about 64 in five weeks. I don't believe that.  Nonetheless, I've decided that my goal weight is going to be between 64 and 65kgs for now. This is based on how I currently look at this weight. (Which was 68.8kg on Saturday morning; 76cm for waist, 91cm for hips.) I want to re-evaluate then. My goal is roughly a 70cm waist. That's all I really want, so whether that happens at my goal weight remains to be seen. My stomach is looking a lot better now that it's toned, so this is a whole new ballgame for me.  Once a week, the lie we tell ourselves.  FP
Blah So I'm noT losing anything what the hell? Day 3 fruit and veg today but my scales has not shifted!  Bit annoyed really, tonight we have "friends" coming over, I really cbf!! I just wanna go home and relax not go home and put up with idiots! I sound horrible but I just don't feel like having em round especially coz of who it is. Nothing else to say, no weightless, no gain, no nothing!  On another note I'm starting to hate this app, I can't comment on posts I can't see everyone's profile properly, I can't follow new ppl & I don't have a dash bored!!!
all or nothing first of all, can anybody tell me how i can get notified of comments? i always tend to have to go into my blog and check. i just want one of those things like on myspace where it's like "new comments!" ha, i'm lazy. i decided that this whole 'losing weight slowly and healthily' thing was just a load of BS. it was TOO slow, and i gave up and binged. it's all or nothing for me. starting next monday, i will be fasting and restricting for summer. shouldn't be hard at all, considering i won't have exams to worry about and i can be anywhere and do whatever i want :) can't wait til freedom. the only thing that sucks about the upcoming freedom is it has to be summer. i HATE summer. i despise it. Here's a list why: 1. It's too hot to exercise, let alone MOVE 2. I get all sweaty and look like a bloated tomato 3. I have to wear clothes that reveal my fat-ness. 4. I break down a lot because of my lack of decent-looking clothing options 5. Clothes shopping is depressing, especially with... 6. BIKINIS!!!!!!!! 7. Can't eat soups :( 8. Having sex is exhausting and makes you all gross and sticky (and not for a good reason) 9. Sleeping in the same bed as my boyfriend is hard because he is a human furnace 10. People don't hug as much :( i love hugs :( 11. I hate icypoles, so when I'm hot i have to resort to icky Ice cream that melts everywhere and makes you stickier than summer sex 12. Makes me crave ice cream more. 13. CBF SUNSCREENING 14. ...and that leads to painful sunburn 15. You have to wear sunglasses and they slide off your nose and get annoying 17. My eye makeup (my trademark) sweats off 18. Having to deal with questions about why I like to wear tshirts and boardies over my bathers (fat stomach and scars on my legs) 19. The Beach! (bikinis + icky sand + salty water = PISSED OFF KATIE) 20. People always want to go out for fish and chips, which usually leads to B/P 21. Salads get boring after a while 22. Did I mention looking like a bloated tomato? 23. Can't do one of my favourite past-times, walking to Frankston, because of the heat 24. Too many BUGS! (i have a phobia of all insects) 25. Lack of sleep due to trying to kill all the aforementioned bugs 26. Being woken up by a buzzing mosquito just as I'm about to fall asleep! 27. Dresses. YUCK. 28. Have to show my fat arms. 29. BUGGGGGGGGGGSSSSSSSSSSS 30. Lack of motivation because of the stupid heat. 31. Winter coldness burns more calories. Enough said? Even so, here are some upsides that will benefit me this summer: 1. Too hot to heat fatty foods (aka chocolate, pasta, curries etc) 2. Excuse to just eat salads, it's too hot for anything else! 3. Cold water to boost metabolism 4. Yummy low-calorie fruit. 5. BOOST FRUIT SMOOOOTHIES when going out for lunch. once again, too hot for anything else. chyeah. and that's about it as far as the good bits of summer goes. so NOT looking forward to it. NOTE TO SELF: this is not the time to be writing blogs, go study for your exams tomorrow!
Do you remember me? Hello lovelies. I'm back after another cheeky fling with recovery. I thought everything was fine and I was getting better, but then I weighed myself after 2 months of 'recovery' and saw a number I've never seen before and never want to see again: 175lbs. 175 fucking pounds of fucking fat. I literally felt sick when I saw what a mess I'd become, so I decided to spend the whole night flirting with my old friend razor blade. It felt so good to punish myself for my gluttony, but I realised I can't carry on dealing with failures like this. I need to deal with them by doing something about them. So here I am again, asking for your forgiveness, apologising for my disappearance, hoping you'll welcome me back into this circle. I've missed you all so much - I'm back now for good, I promise. I've decided to call this not a new start, but a new ending. I've had too many new starts and they've all ended in failure. This is my new ending, the beautiful ending I'm creating for myself. A beautiful, thin ending. Now I'm fully settled back into uni life after my placement (placement = place of evil wherein I gained 10lbs) I figure, what better way to step towards my new, beautiful ending than with the ABC diet. Week	Mon	Tues	Wed	Thurs	Fri	Sat	Sun Week 1	500	500	300	400	100	200	300 Week 2	400	500	Fast	150	200	400	350 Week 3	250	200	Fast	200	100	Fast	300 Week 4	250	200	150	100	50	100	200 Week 5	200	300	800	Fast	250	350	450 Week 6	Fast	500	450	400	350	300	250 Week 7	200	200	250	200	300	200	150 Week 8	Fast	ABC ends. I'm starting tomorrow with 500 cals. Does anyone want to join me? I've never done it before but I'm really excited to get back on track. I missed you all so much, did I mention that? Hope you've all been okay and you'll have me back :) I'll post again in a few days pinkie promise :) Rydw i'n caru ti, Kiki xx
Healthy start So.. I'm on the road to a new body started my clean eating plan yesterday (Monday) joined up at the gym as well and started packing really healthy lunches and snacks for work. Today: Breakfast-oats with rice milk blueberries and a dash of cinnamon  Morning snack- banana and strawberry smoothie made with Greek yoghurt. Lunch -rye wrap with chicken baby spinach tomato and cucumber. Afternoon snack -rye crackers with boiled egg and cottage cheese. Dinner- kangaroo steak and steamed broccoli and cauliflower. It sounds like a lot but there's really not much calories in everything if u think about it, I'm supposed to eat 5-6 small meals a day every 2-3 hours. Anyway I'm really enjoying it so far even tho it's only day 2. I should take some pics of myself for before shots! I hate those but hopefully I can make one of those awesome before and after pictures  Other than that beau finally got a job, hence the reason we can afford to go to the gym now even tho I am paying for him, I guess he paid for me last time we went to the other gym so yea... This is great I feel like this will be one of the best summers everrr!! I got such a good deal joining up, didn't pay a start up fee or anything because the manager of the club lives with the girl I work with, she lives in a share house so anyway, still unfair she gets her membership for free tho lol.  So that's all for now, hope everyone is doing well.
Just another rant... I don't matter. I'm worthless. I can't do anything right. I am a failure. I'm not skinny enough. I don't have 'real' anorexia.I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I want to recover, I really do, but I can't until I reach my GW. Then my anorexia will be real, will be valid, will count for something. Then I will actually have something to recover from. I'm the only person who can't have a serious eating disorder unless I reach a really low weight. My mom doesn't get it, my treatment team doesn't get it, my dad sure as hell doesn't get it, I WILL recover if they let me reach a 13.7 bmi. I would be fine, then when I reach it I will begin the recovery process. If They don't let me reach it I don't know what I'll do. I want to kill my self so bad because I know that I'll never get to a weight that low, but im too much of a pussy to go through with it. Every time I see someone whose been or currently is at a bmi lower than 13 I want to kill myself. How selfish am I? I don't feel bad for them, I feel angry and jeolous. I feel like if I can't even get near that than I am a failure and therefore don't belong on this earth. But I am scared of pain, ugh goddamit evolution. I don't matter, I'm worthless, I'm untalented... I doubt anyone actually read through this whole thing. Why am I even posting this? Maybe I'm seeking validation that I don't deserve. Maybe I want someone to tell me that I really am skinny enough,good enough, enough. How stupid is that, I'm fishing for compliments. Fuck me. Wait, who would want to it's not like I'm attractive. I'll leave now and go wallow in self pity, and stuff myself with food that I'm being forced to eat. Or at least I tell myself I'm forced to eat, when in reality I'm a fatass, I'm too weak to choose the tube over the yummy plate in front of me. Really I'm a selfish bitch who doesn't deserve to be comforted.
What I Ate Yesterday Breakfast: Mio Energy (Mio Energy Water Enhancer + Water) Lunch: One cube of Tofu, fifteen soy beans, some celery Dinner: Pancakes (1 cup of oats, 1 banana, 3 tbs water), Chinese Food (A small amount and only one plate full. I have small plates at my house, so that’s not as much as it sounds like. And my dad practically forced me to eat it. If it had been up tome, I wouldn’t have.) Stay Skinny Sweethearts 🙂 ❤ ~Robin
Day#1 I decided im going to starting posting my progress here because it will keep me accountable. Today with all my running around i burned 350calories. I fasted for 22hours and at the end ate a small apple-48cal(i didnt finish it all) later i had some lucky charms and animal crackers(which im trying to get out the carbs)-85cal and popcorn-114cal. In all i had 247 calories today. And am back at fasting. I lost 1lbs (108 to 107). If anyone has tips to how i can do better please tell me! I hate being this weight... Thank you so much for reading!
Dreaming... We all dream of complete, absolute perfection. Becoming those thinspirational pictures we stare at for hours on end. When somebody tells us we look 'weak', 'fragile' and that we 'need to get some meat on our bones'- that's like music to our ears. We dream of becoming gorgeously thin, with tiny perfect arms and legs, with sticking out ribs and collarbones. We dream of having complete self-control, of saying "No thank you" to every food forced upon us, saying "Yes please" to skinny in our minds. This isn't just a quick fix. It's a way of life. For life. And this is what we're meant to be. And we will give anything for our dreams. Starving, purging, control, running untill we're weak and faint with exhaustion. This isn't just our dream, it's our reality. Because it has to happen. It has to. She keeps me going. Always there in my head.  Today i lost a further 4lbs! I am so happy. I am now at 168lbs (12 stone)!!!! I am so happy!! I'm under 170lbs so i've only got 16lbs left to loose before my christmas target weight! My boyfriend is over at the moment, and i've convinved him i'm ill, therefore I can only eat a small portion of thin-a-soup in a mug to help my throat (win!!!) Keep going all you beautiful people, today is a good day! Think thin  X
Introduction to blog heyo! so i'm starting this blog because i am sick and tired of failing to lose weight and ending back up at my goal weight and hating myself. this blog will include daily weigh ins, daily food intake and i will also be sharing my struggles and tips that i have! My current weight is 166.4 which will go up tmrw because i binged but im gonna fast tmrw. my goal weight is 130 lbs but i would be SOOO HAPPY if i could get under it. i have been attempting to diet and exercise for 3 weeks and have failed badly so THIS NEEDS to change.
Back, again.. Wow, it's been months since I last posted on here. I know I keep flitting back and forward on here, but I think I might be back to stay this time. I really helped me last time, I didn't feel like it was working at the time, but looking back over the photos I took of myself this time last year, I would do anything to be that weight again. I wish I'd appreciated it back then. I wish I'd gone out in skimpy outfits and been proud of how tiny I was, instead of just hating myself and feeling fat. Cos now I am fat. Fat fat. I've gained so much weight in the past year, it's disgusting. No wonder my boyfriend left me. He was the reason I 'recovered', he was the reason I started eating more and gained weight. And ultimately he left me because I gained too much. He fell in love with me and my lowest weight, when eating in front of him made me cry, and I was too weak to function properly. Clearly that's what guys like, who wants a fat healthy girl right? So yeah, here I am. I've popped online every now and then to check up on your blogs, but not recently. I need to get updated and see who still uses this site, see who's still here. I won't post my weight it's too embarrassing. Maybe in a few months when I'm more acceptable. I'm meeting my ex next Thursday for a drink. I'm being optimistic and hoping I can lose something by then. Obviously I'm not gonna lose stones, but even half a stone would make some difference, I hope? I'll update again tomorrow hopefully. I need to get some control over my life back. I feel uncontrollable, literally unstoppable. I don't even know what's happened to me. I'm a complete trainwreck. And maybe losing weight will make me happier, more confident. Help me find someone to love me again. I'm so bloody lonely.

It's a Cycle Thank you so much haze, determined girl, The Secret Me, Anna and B. for your beautiful comments, it's so reassuring to know that I will always be welcomed back with open arms, that I have a place where I know that every part of me is accepted. I love you all. It's odd how this 'eating thing' starts and grows... To this day it's impossible to explain that jump from 'life not going well' to 'lose weight to no end, that'll fix it' but I'm sure you guys will understand. It's odd the way it tears away from you and then pulls you back in... at least that's what it has done to me. There are theories, sure -- I'm insecure, my life is unstable -- but people are still left standing asking 'why?' It's a fair question. Why? Why would a well-off, passably pretty, passably talented girl dream and dream of destroying herself in the way that I do? After all, I don't have 'problems'. I'm not disabled, or terminally ill, or physically bullied, or sexually abused, or starving to death in Africa. I'm 'starving' myself in Australia. I don't know... I enjoy the calorie counting... it calms me. I plan my days eating in the morning or even a day before but of course there are days when a spanner is chucked in the works. Today for example, I planned on eating around 500 calories and burning roughly the same amount but no, I get home and mum had bought me two rolls of sushi and a mini cake... so of course I eat that and my days intake has jumped up to 900... the gym is soon though so I'm alright for now... I can feel the fat hanging off my bones. I just feel oily and, well, fat. I can't wait to work it all off. I can't handle this feeling right now. I've stopped seeing my psychiatrist which I'm happy about. She was lovely but I couldn't continue seeing her when I knew I wasn't being 100% honest. I thought I was ready for recovery when I went... but I'm not. Which makes me happy... Things are all about to change... I graduate in a week and a half, followed by a month of exams and then high school is over for me forever. It's incredibly daunting even though I know I should be excited. I also have to go to the beach next week which I'm incredibly anxious about. I'm not ready. My body is not ready. No one wants to see this. I have a party this Friday that I'm looking forward to, I'm planning on keeping my calories low but my alcohol intake high and I'm going to dance dance dance (burn burn burn). Ha. That sounds a bit messed up. Oh, there's also a guy in my life at the moment. We're not officially going out but... who knows. I guess I'll elaborate more on that later. I'm sorry if my thoughts are ramshackled and all over the place. Again, I love you all to bits. xxxxxxxxx
something fun perhaps? ughhh. binged today. i had a girl scout meeting. yes girl scouts. its good for college so be quite! :P (the downside is the glorious cookies) anyways. we had bagels and this like egg pie thing. oh yeah keish i think. so yeah. not good. but i didnt have one bagle. i had three bagel halves PLUS cream cheese. exactly. then i was just like. why the fuck not. and had some cookies. (I GOT TO TASTE THE NEW FLAVOR!!! :D). and then everyone left and im alone in my house (we have the meetings at my house. and then i had russion wedding cookies or whatever and good and plenty and pie crust. ughhhh good news: since no ones home i can exercise vigorously and not be called anorexic by my twin sister :) i want to do something fun with the Pro-Ana community out there. soooo i was thinking we could share holiday thinspo? just a thought. TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK!  ♥ katy
Intro... I've never been good at first impressions... There is so much to consider with them. We were told at a training day, "You only have 30 seconds to approach someone new. And 4 minutes after that to wow them with your personality" 4 minutes to change their judgement of you. Everything about you. The way you look, dress, sound smile, stand, smell. They will know if you're friendly. Or if you're a bitch. If you're outgoing, or shy. If you're nice, funny, smart, a failure.. skinny........ or fat........ We all do it, heck I do it with every single person I pass by on the streets. Guessing if they're just naturally skinny, or going through the exact same thing that I wish I could be. Yes, I know that sounds bad of me but heck, I said i wasn’t good at first impressions.. But here? It's safe. Nobody judges. Because in all honesty, isn’t everybody who's reading this, thinking the same thing? We're all trying to achieve the same thing. Trying to BE the same thing. All wishing and wanting and desiring perfection. Complete. Utter. PERFECTION. But, I'm ashamed. I'm no where near the perfection I desire so badly. Not even close. I'm huge. In the past two years I’ve ballooned from 140 - 180 lbs. I've spent several days now purging and bingeing, and starving and running and binging and purging and running and fainting. Now I need to let this all out and a diary helped me through my worst days when I was younger. At least on here, I have someone who can relate to me. So here’s a few things you should know about me… - My hair has been just about every single shade under the sun. - Currently it’s dark brown. - I hate it. - My boyfriend loves my curves. I don’t know why he cant see how fat I am. - I used to cut. And it’s not something I’m proud of. It’s been 4 years and I still feel the urge. But I won't bring myself to it. - On here, I’m an open book. In real life, nobody knows what I am going through and the full details of my past. - I have to wear makeup. Absolutely have to. - I over think way too much. - I love to write. And I love to draw. Some day I WILL be a famous writer. - I don’t care if it’s gay. I dream of waking up and finding out that I’m a mermaid.. - I don’t listen to the music that people ‘assume’ I will like. I like that. I’ve always felt the need to be thin. I used to be very large in my younger years, and when I hit 13 my weight plummeted down to 120 lbs… I’ve never been able to reach that again. I hate myself for the incapacity to have so much self control over my weight. I need to get control back. I need to be perfect. I will have my perfect body and I will sustain it and I will fight to get there. Height: 5ft 8in Weight: 176lbs BMI: 26.8Goal Weight: 110lbs Goal BMI: 16.7 I will get there.
Ana? Mia? Edie? From here. This girl seems to have been told that Ana isn't right for her. This isn't at all scientific, but for me Ana is restriction, Mia is ritual and Edie is a bit of everything. Edie is what I refer to a non-specified Eating Disorder as. EDNOS is, after all, a mouthful. Keep those mouths empty!
thin lisalisa asked me a question on my last blog.  Is there anything else (healthy) in your life that gives you the same sense of satisfaction and control? no. never. and it's never really been about control for me. well, kind of, at the start. but it was also about weight and food. it's still about weight and food. call me wanna-rexic, whatever, thats just how it is for me. i want to lose weight. i want to be thin. that's all it's ever been for me. i want collarbones, hipbones, cheekbones, wrist bones, shoulder bones...  thats all i ever wanted, and it's still what i want. and i am SO glad i threw out lasagne again tonight. mum just came in and lectured me about study. AGAIN. fucking hell why won't she just leave me alone? she thinks i should be getting 99% for fucking everything. well i'm not that fucking smart! i hate the expectations i have to live up to. it's moments like these that i get so angry that i skip meals. and i always get really upset when she does it after dinner, so i cant skip it. it makes me feel helpless. i rebel by not eating, and get thinner at the same time. maybe it isn't always about food.. i'd be cutting too, if it wasn't for the boy. everytime i used to cut myself, it'd be like cutting him twice as deep. as long as i'm with him, i don't cut. i'm over six months free of self harm now. i still have scars on my hands, arms, and most of all on my legs (which i never show anyway). tough reminder. i know i'd go back to cutting the second the boy ever breaks up with me. he keeps me alive.
I always felt better when I didn't eat. I guess I believed that maybe one day I would be able to look acceptable and soon it became a way of life. I saw that I was losing weight, but that wasnt enough. I wanted to lose more.  Remember to have Your Say. For a very long time I believed that it was my own thoughts and it took a lot of time - about a year - to be able to accept that they werent my own thoughts but something else.  It had convinced me that if I lost enough weight and became thin then I would also become acceptable and successful. I believed this lie for a long time.  This went on for a long time and my doctor told my parents to just let me do whatever and that I would eat when I was hungry.  I kept to myself that I was putting up with the constant bullying that no one else could see. They didn't understand and there was no way that I could tell them about my reasoning.  Looking back, that was a stupid thing to do.  I don't like seeing my reflection in mirrors as I hate everything I see. Wherever I am I always analyse the people around me to figure out who looks better than me.  Even though I'm getting better, my eating disorder doesn't stop telling me how disgusting I am, how fat I am and how I'm so worthless.  Eating disorders are not just about the food. There is so much more. They distort reality and you begin to believe these lies and nothing else. You live a life full of anxiety and fear. It's a scary way to live your life, it really is.  I've made it this far and one day, maybe I'll be able to say that I've beaten this eating disorder that has taken so much. It's not an easy thing to do
Update Hey lovelies, thanks for all your kind words =) My stomach hurts with all the different drugs I am not now. On Cinnamon's suggestion I bought some meal replacement shake powder and by golly gumdrops that's amazing. I was embarrassed to be looking at that shelf so I just grabbed the first one I saw instead of comparing the different calories etc in them, so mine is pretty high in cals but oh well! Today I have eaten six of these Italian dish style things, rice and vegies in a sort of batter/crumbing. Hugely not so good for you but I drank the laxative, diuretic tea and to be honest, it kind of cheered me up to have a little binge. I also ate 2 x small tins of tuna, some dried apricots and some pecorino cheese, as well as the meal replacement shakes, x2. I have a regime of tablets to take which sucks and makes my stomach upset (and yes, I know the laxative, diuretic teas wouldn't be helping), so I think my goal through this stage will be first and foremost protecting my stomach - i.e. calorie intake and absolutely no purging until I'm off the meds. Hello and welcome to my new followers =) Comment replies: "I feel great": A.S. - I have THE most bizarre cravings too sometimes! I went through a vinegar phase too! Although once I had wayy too much and well *cue nausea, vomiting* Sarah: yes they are, aren't they! I'd never really appreciated them before but I think if I am forced into going out for a meal I'm going to order a dish with croutons. Yup. Cinnamon: Excellent suggestions. I think when I have finished with the teas + meal replacement shakes, I am going to make juice/shakes with various herbs etc. The bloating link is useful but I think it's important to differentiate between bad bloating - i.e. sorbitol, lactose vs good bloating with fibre, which will lead to bloating at the time related to the bowel motions but once it's been excreted the stomach should be flatter than before. "Boo.": A.S., Cinnamon, Skinny Business: Thanks for your thoughts =) Miana - I am so not happy about having to take a billion and one meds a day - and yeah, I'm hoping my weight loss doesn't get too messed up! I'm on valium, amongst other things and given my work outs are usually quite strength based I'm worried about the impact the muscle relaxant properties will have... *sigh*. Have a lovely Saturday all! xxK

Support buddy Hi! I'm just reentering this because I gained a lot of weight pretty quickly after "recovery" and I feel like I could do much better with someone to talk to and support eachother, I know none of my friends would understand. I'm 20 years old, 6 ft, and currently weigh 188lbs, my goal is 150, and my lowest was 140. I can download whatsapp or kik I would just like to have a buddy or even a group so we can help and support eachother. 
Why oh Why Driving home from work this week I have been listening to one of my favourite CD’s, Ben Haenow. The last track on the album is my favourite ("Something I need") and the first few lines are thought provoking: “I had a dream the other night, about how we only get one life”. It is a coincidence (or fate, as I like to believe)that I have been reading one of my diaries from school as well this week and on the 12th January 2004, aged 15, I wrote: “I really hope I do get to be an athlete when I’m older because you only get one life and that’s what I want to do in it”. It is true. We do only get one life and it is what we make of it. But unfortunately, anorexia has robbed me of much of my life. And here I am, at 27, with many years wasted due to anorexia and still, at present, time (and life) is passing by while I stay clinging on. Why, I ask, do I stay holding on to this devil that is anorexia when it has destroyed and continues to destroy so much of my life? My dreams have been shattered, my self-esteem and confidence demolished, my health and fertility wrecked, my friends vanished, my family exhausted, much of my life lost…all thanks to anorexia. This is the destruction it has caused yet I still cling on to it for dear life. But anorexia doesn’t allow life, at best, you get an existence. And I know this, I am well aware of how demonic anorexia is and I know that my life is slipping by as I remain in its clutches. But I can’t let go. And I don’t know why. Logic and common sense do not prevail. Anorexia destroys and it led me to this Something that is making me so miserable you would think I would try and get rid of at every opportunity. But my mind tells me, Yes life is miserable with anorexia but it would be even worse without it and I need it to cope with the trials of daily life. I am nothing without anorexia; it is my identity, it is who I am. I have never been, and never will be the pretty one, or the chatty one, or the fun one so at least, by having anorexia I can be someone…the anorexic one. But to most people this isn’t an attractive or likeable trait and again, my head knows this but still, it has me trapped. Anorexia has been a part of my life now for so long I can’t remember a time without it. I think fear has a big part to play in my hold for anorexia. Fear of the unknown and fear of disappointment. Life is full of disappointments and I can’t deal with them, so I will just stick with being anorexic. The thought of change is scary and another saying that seems relevant to my life-better the devil you know. But is this true? This week, there have been two highlights, occasions where I have actually felt happy and anorexia was non-existent during these times. It is only over the past year that I have started to have moments of happiness. Yes, they are few and far between but they are there. Tuesday night I went to my athletics training and I loved it. More than I ever have before. Not because I was burning calories, not because I was pushing my body, I was just enjoying running and doing it with other people. And ‘exercise’ and ‘enjoy’ are two words I never thought I would use in the same sentence…this was something anorexia had robbed me of as well. Exercise had become a chore, I was a slave to it, and I hated it. But not my current athletics training. This I truly do enjoy. The second happy occasion was Friday afternoon, going to the cinema with a friend. A really good friend. And I had a really good time. Anorexia has prevented me going to the cinema in the past. It took away friends that I could go with and it took away my ability to sit down. Going to the cinema with a friend is just a small thing and something that everyone else does in everyday life. But it is a small thing that has made a big difference to me. Being with great company, chatting, and doing something together, now that made me happy. Me at the cinema with my good friend Both those occasions during the week made me happier than anorexia has ever made me. And I know moments like these would probably become more regular the more I let go of anorexia. My life would be more independent, care-free, spontaneous and enjoyable (probably) if I were to let go of anorexia. But I can’t and it frustrates me. Why does such a big part of me still WANT to be anorexic? Why can’t I want, 100%, wholeheartedly, to get better completely? This would make the idea of ‘recovery’ so much easier, because I could just get on and do it. However, before there wasn’t even 1% of me wanting to get better and now it is something I do think about and a fair amount of the time I do want. So, at the moment I am living in a state of confusion and it causes stress. I want to be anorexic, I want to be better. I want to lose weight, I want to have a life. I’m scared of losing anorexia, I’m scared of life staying like it is. Daily battles in my head that I have to fight. But at least now the counter arguments to anorexia are there. And hopefully they will keep niggling away, chipping down my grip on anorexia until one day, I will face the fear and make the change. There is a lot about me and my anorexia that I don’t know, but that I do know.
Thank God It's Sunday Intake: 666 cal ;) Burnt running: 432 Burnt doing housework: 240 Net intake: -6 Chicken on toast for lunch with mum, scone & cupcake for afternoon tea, and only had 3/9 nachos I made for dinner because I was still so full. Success :) Only got in 2.5L water today, but it's better than nothing :) Plan for tomorrow: 200 cal, 500-1,000 burnt (have a visitor tomorrow, but not sure if it'll cut into my burn time, or eating plan for that matter :S). Hoping to get an hour of running and a few hours of cleaning in in the morning before she comes over. It's a little after 7PM now, so I'll easily be out by 8, up by 4AM. I'll try to get on the trainer earlier tomorrow, but no promises there (especially if housework comes first). Blood, sweat, and elbow grease! (Yes, I'm a bit of  a homemaker at heart) Weekends have started to be a slow time for me these past few weeks. Monday's are always great. Especially when I eat more on Sunday like I did today, I'm even more motivated for the week ahead. Today was a bit hard emotionally, and I don't expect tomorrow to be much better. I'm just getting anxious about no contact from J for so long, when things are 'finished-finished'. But I'm trying really hard to stay positive at the moment. Don't be surprised if I crash in a heap next week, though, but for now I'll just roll with the punches. Come at me, world! Hope you're all trying to stay positive, and motivated for the coming week! :) xxBella
the ice is getting thinner Tips I've picked up on my rounds on pro-ana sites that I think have potential/tried and tested: - Keep a stash of prothinspo images. Google image search 'go to' celebs you know wouldn't ever fail you for when you're feeling weak, eg Kate Bosworth, Kate Moss, Lindsay Lohan, Erin Wasson. - Drink black tea, black coffee or water whenever you feel hungry! The caffeine in tea and coffee will perk you up, the water will clean out your body and tea is filled with antioxidants. They also fill you up :-) - Wear a rubber band around your wrist and snap it when you want to eat. You will train yourself not to think about eating. - Eat in front of the mirror (naked or not!). - Fidget fidget fidget! - If you feel like you need to binge, go for a walk and make yourself busy for 20 minutes. If you're on your own, do starjumps in front of the mirror! - Chew very slowly. Break the food down as much as possible! You will feel fuller quicker. - Eat seaweed or take kelp pills to boost your metabolism. - Sleep as much as possible. Not only does that mean you skip meals, it is also proven that those that sleep more tend to eat less than those who do not.
Each day is getting easier and harder Since I had my frozen strawberry yoghurt (30) made last night, I could start my day earlier without waking people with loud kitchen appliances. I got up at 4, and at 4:30 I popped it from the fridge to the freezer, did a short warm-up run, and now I'm waiting for my yoghurt to freeze up a lite more :) So I'll be having breakfast at 5am, running again by 5:30. I want to get 45 minutes done before mum gets up, then another 15-45 depending on how I'm going. My friend who cancelled on me the other day is popping around at some point this afternoon, but I'm not too sure how long for. I asked her to come around after lunch, so I know I won't need to eat around her. Either way, busy morning, relaxing afternoon, <350 calories. I am disgusted by how much I've been eating the past few days, and I need to change it. So, the plan is to run 60-90 minutes this morning, keep on the move, then stop after lunch and relax (in the shed, away from food). Oh, and the soup I made last night? A-MAZ-ING! So dinner is sorted for the first time in days - no excuses :) Next measurement date: June 5th Next weigh (if measurements are on track): June 14th After I next weigh, I'm gonna start a 30 day challenge :)
My eating disorder has got hold of me and everyday I feel revolting, miserable, and totally confused about my thoughts. I feel that I`m insane- I don`t know which thoughts are my own and which are not. I feel that nobody can convince me otherwise in my thinking that people don`t like someone as much when they are fatter. I have that notion firmly implanted in my brain, and I feel it`s unerasable.  I convince myself that it`s too much for me, and then I try to live normally... and it never happens. Because I CAN`T live normally and I am not allowed to.. and my eating disorder tells me that I actaully don`t want to... and so I am trapped forever. It has me, in every possible way. And it doesn`t want me to let it go, and it convinces me that I don`t want to let it go. How do you help that? Won`t somebody please help us..
I'm sick; As the heading states, I'm sick. On and off fever, terrible headache and just feeling bleeeerh. I hate missing school, as lame as that sounds. I've also been eating SO MUCH FOOD! Seriously, I don't think I've ever eaten so much. The thing is though, my bodies craving food so that it can get better, and I've been letting myself eat all kinds of things in hope that I'll get better really soon. The good thing is, I don't think I've put on that much weight since being sick because I was already fat to begin with thanks to the holidays. My body's been craving crazy things, like yesterday I had low fat ice cream with a crumbled weight watcher brownie. I dont even like either of those things. Oh well... I guess once I'm over whatever this is I can finally concentrate on getting THINNER. Oh! Guess what! Ok... during the holidays I accidentally drunkenly told two of my guy friends about my eating disorder... and since then they told my school counsellor who then rang my parents and told them. Then when they asked me about it I was like "phhhhh, no way man". And they were fine with that. Am I really that fat now that it's 'not possible' for me to have an eating disorder? If I was at my lowest weight right now they'd be all "PUT ON WEIGHT GIRL AND GET HELP". Anyway, sorry this blog is a bit... weird and out of character haha. That's just what happens when I'm sick. I'm finding it a bit hard to catch up on all your blogs and I'm really sorry about that. Once I get my own laptop (which shouldn't be too far away) it'll be so much easier :) Thank you all so so much for your comments, I appreciate it so so so so much. When I read your comments I get the biggest smile on my face. I look quite ridiculous haha. Girls, I hope that you guys feel like you can ask me all kinds of questions whenever you want. I love answering them and helping people if I can. Bonnie Blue O', to answer your question, I haven't had my period since early October/late September last year. You haven't had yours for two years?!? Wow... i know I'm not one to talk, but that's not good. I really think you should go see a doctor about it. Not having a period for so long can have bad affects sometimes. A doctor can fix it, I advise that you go see your doctor ASAP my love. I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH! xxx
I went back to my therapist and I actually managed to tell him I've wanted to die, every day for the last few months. He finally seems to be taking me a bit more seriously. He seemed understanding, I'm going back weekly for a while. He even booked me in for appointments after my 18th birthday which I don't think he's allowed to do since it's a child and adolescent clinic, but he said he's scared to let me disappear at least until after my exams. For the evening before my appointment and a lot of the day I was in an unexpected good mood, I actually saw some hope and a purpose in life. Then out of nowhere in the evening I lost my mind. I'm trying not to cut anymore since it's summer soon, so I went mental punching every inch of my body but it didn't hurt enough. I settled for trying to break my arm by beating it with various hard objects. I didn't break it, but today I have the most disgusting bruise it hurts to brush up against anything. I really don't know what triggered it. I've never been that crazy before. I have history coursework due in tomorrow (well technically it was due months ago, my teacher's extended my deadline to literally hours before the exams board will want it sent off). I doubt I'll get it down. All I want to do right now is cry and sleep forever. But I can't let her down again. She's been too nice about it. I can't turn up empty handed. I'm such a worthless idiotic bitch.
What the fuck has my life come to.. So, I attempted to date.. :/ He shows up 30mins late in a tracksuit -_- Chats up the girl taking our order, then goes on to tell me he was chatting her up  incase I didn't know.. Oh and at one point he called me a dick?! I think it was when he was telling me about how he'd slept with 3 people in 24 hours... oh and there was something about a cow he reared that wouldn't eat so choked on solids and they had to step on it's belly and then went on to make noises in the middle of Nando's in case I didn't know what sound a cow made.... oh and did I mention he didn't even pay for me..? He just ordered his food chatted up the girl and walked back to the table.. :/ I don't have a clue how someone could act like that..I pulled the old "oh no my friends have an emergency I need to go..." trick lol Hope everybody else is ok & doesn't have to deal with shit like this.. I've lost about a stone again, don't know why I allow myself to get this huge.. Back in size 12/14..down to working about 65 hours a week and having no time to eat...? Even though I work at a chinese restaurant! *High5 to me*

I Am So Over Starving Myself ... but it's the only way I know how to lose weight quickly. Us ED types know that losing a pound a week is just not enough.  My weight is gross, my eating habits are uncontrolled. I've been telling myself that I don't want to starve myself and that I can do this the 'normal' way by correcting my diet and exercising. But I just end up eating too much during the day and then I fail at night, because I'm like - well this extra 1000 calories isn't going to make a difference, so give me that jar of peanut butter.  Today, I'm gonna aim for 800 calories.  Thus far, I've had a small tortilla (122), a tiny avocado (100), free from cheese (50?) and a nectarine (63) and that's a total of 335 cals. I'm going to have a cup of coffee now with soy milk and then that's it till dinner. For dinner, I think I'll have the same tortilla wrap.  This has been the most fabulously lazy weekend, I've done nothing. And my flat is kinda clean, so I don't even have to worry too much about sorting that out either. I may do some laundry now.  A bit later, I've got yoga and I'm doing a double class - an hour and a half of normal and then an hour of restorative, which is almost better than sex.  I'm meant to be video chatting with Chris later, but I just don't feel mentally like I'm in a place where I want to speak to him. So I might skip that.

Let the Challenge Begin… November 30, 2014 love2bethin4life 10 day challenge, 5lbs, challenge, extreme diet 2 Comments Monday, the beginning of a fresh week and the start of the challenge! Your all probably wondering what the challenge actually is, so I will get to the point. Myself and fellow pro-ana chat members are competing to be the first one to lose 5lbs (approx. 2kg) whilst also following the 10 day challenge —> I’m also going to pay for a weeks gym access… maybe more if I can afford it, but I’ll cross that bridge later. Anyway, feel free to participate in the challenge. I will be posting my points from the 10 day challenge everyday so if you want you can also post yours bellow as a comment, I would love to see that <3. Stay strong – A oxoxo
the 100 calorie workout :) (100 calorie workout #1 one time through this workout will burn 100 calories. each time you repeat it, you will burn 100 calories. there are 3500 calories in a pound, get to work 20 push-ups 15 squats 50 jumping jacks 30 crunches)
144 144lbs that is, when I stepped on the scales test morning. BMI 18.4. So the number is not as bad as I thought but I feel big anyway. Story of my adult life! ?? Because the weight number sounds high regardless, I feel like I have to specify BMI to clarify I'm not medically overweight. There was a question on MPA asking "Who are you in competition with?" Myself. Each goal weight needs to be beaten by reaching it, then getting lower. Ultimately its a race that cannot be won, but I'm running it anyway. That might be where disorder overtakes logic? LW: 135lbs/BMI 17.3. in Nov 2016
Time to find Thin Regardless of other people perceiving me as "slim" or "thin" or similar, I've rarely seen it. It's time to find it. There are tiny hints of what could be, but they are not enough. Weight/BMI: Approx 146lbs/18.7 at 6ft 2". The weight will be checked tomorrow morning.
sympathy for the devil I have finally cracked it! I'm lying in bed clutching at my stomach and have the biggest smile on my face because I'm back to where I should be. I can feel my belly tingling like little bells are rocking against the insides and ringing out the sound of success, of beauty and control and everything else. And I have no desire to eat at all.  I have been trying something different this time. Before, I could go straight from normal to 500 calories a day without any slow descent. My recent binging (that has been going on since 1 January!) is going to require a bit more of a downgrading, particularly seeing as I didn't put on any weight from eating takeaways and chocolate like it was going out of fashion due to a lot of exercise and sea kelp. I have been so busy at work that I don't really have enough time to eat much anymore. I have a slice of toast in the morning, copious amounts of tea and coffee throughout the day, a salad or soup for lunch, followed by perhaps some crisps, and then whatever my parents make for dinner. I am still mostly eat dinner at the moment. I skip it only once or twice a week: slow descents. I take any excuse at work to walk to other departments and rooms, fidgeting, fidgeting, fidgeting constantly. I haven't weighed myself for the past couple of days. I got my period on Friday which would explain why I was 119lbs, but that's also quite a promising sign. I will be 114lbs by the end of the week. Two people called me tiny on Saturday night. What a lovely word! A little misplaced right now but it will sound better next to my name soon enough.  I have a date tomorrow night. Another excuse to skip dinner!
Lies Lies Lies It is far too hot and sticky today and I am far too sweaty sitting here in the little study, tap tap tapping away at the keyboard in a room surrounded by books to give you guys a proper post, so this shall be fairly short. I made a mistake. I let my mum read my copy of Unbearable Lightness and now she's become suspicious. She wants me to talk to the school counsellor about my best friends all moving to the country but I refuse. I'm not talking to the counsellor about my 'problems' ever again. Mum says that if I don't talk about my 'problems' or 'issues' then they can come out in other ways. She also gave me the 'you need to put on weight' talk. She also said that people have noticed my weight loss. She asked if I knew how much I weigh, to which I replied no, I don't weight myself. She asked if my periods were regular, to which I said yes, I had it a week ago. I haven't had my period in roughly three months. She also said that anorexia can sneak up on you, I just smiled to myself and thought 'I know that and too bad, I'm too far in this now.' ps. Welcome new followers! I can't believe I've cracked the 50 mark! also, thank you all for your beautiful, beautiful, BEAUTIFUL comments. I love you all, my secret little butterflies. xxx
I'm Back... Hey guys, Thank you for all your kind words! Thought I might put a little something as i'm feeling a bit more optimistic! Yesterday I lost 2lbs, because I had half a roast chicken sandwich and a handful of grapes, and did a 4 mile run- soooo proud of myself! So today me and the bf are having a summer salad out in the garden cause it is just such dreamy weather, so hopefully that i'll help keep the lbs off! I now know how much support I have on here, and hopefully I can regain my blogging routine. Strawberry, I eat oranges instead cause I despise grapefruit! Faaaaar to sour for my liking! And tuna is a god in disguise! ;) and yeah I'm going to try and have a lot more steamed broccoli and cauliflower if I get hunger pangs. But recently I'm just not feeling hungry! Today I had a petit filous and the other half of the sandwich from yesterday, so I'm doing well. I just keep thinking, don't! because you will hate yourself tomorrow. Thank you so much for everything :) Here's some summer thinpso for you all to enjoy :) Xxx
Motivation???... Someone.... Somewhere???? Ok nothing is working, im in desperate need of motivation... So bad it's not even funny! My life sucks right now, B got the sack last week so we're stuck on a single income (mine) my eating sucks, my exercise is lost and I'm not sure I'll find it anytime soon... I feel fat and pathetic!  Blah! I never post cause I'm so hopeless there isn't anything worth saying, if I do it will just be a rant like this post and I'm sure nobody wants to read that....  I need a plan, a diet, a fitness program, a lifestyle change... Something!!!!
Skinny Love I'm so sorry to brag gorgeous girls but today has been another good day for my eating, I'm thanking a relaxing weekend at home. Breakfast: an avocado roll, = 149 calories Lunch: 3 raw cauliflower flowerets (isn't floweret an awesome word? I just learnt today that that is what the little cauliflower pieces are called) and a mug of rose and french vanilla tea, = 10 calories I haven't had dinner yet but am planning on having 1 cup of cauliflower soup which will equal to 93 calories. This will bring todays calorie intake to 252. Woohoooo :P I'm not under 49 kilos yet though... I think I'm going to have to keep on going for a little while for that to happen. Now girlies, I need your help. I've realised that a lot of my meals have carbohydrates as I loooove bread *licks lips* and I don't mind the odd pasta. Any suggestions on vegetarian meals that don't have a lot of carbohydrates? Good luck with the week, think skinny Love you all, Anafly xxx
So, I got on the scale last night and my heart practically leaped out of my chest. 111.6!!! A new low! Using the energy from my absolute elation, I went straight from my shower into my crunches and practically passed out in bed. The next morning, I weighed myself again and BOOM!!! 109.5 I cannot remember the last time I was this happy! I’m almost able to forget my doctor’s appointment today. Almost. I got a new water enhancer called Mio Energy and I think it’s what helped me drop those extra pounds. It has no calories, but is sweet so it helps quell sugar cravings. It also passes through you like tea so it gives me a sense of temporary heaviness, not permanent weight like normal water does. It also has vitamins in it, so that’s good 🙂 I am so unbelievably happy, you have NO CLUE. I was honestly worried that I would never be able to drop below 113, and I almost started crying when I saw that beautiful number on the scale. I am one step closer to my ultimate goal weight 🙂 And it’s a damn big step ❤ Stay Strong and Skinny, My Lovelies 🙂 ~Robin ❤
:)? Hello lovelies. So today went well I think. I ate: 4 rice cakes = 120 shapers chocolate = 81 vegetable stir fry = 400? 2 x coffee = 10 3 x tea = 30 hot chocolate = 40 = 681. I'm sure that's wrong somehow because I don't feel hungry. Argggg I'm always so scared I've messed up counting my calories. Even though I've been doing this so damn long I know how to add for gods sake. Wep :( So the food side of things seems to be going okay? I've been well under 1000 the past 2 days. My goal is to get down to eating 500 a day. By next monday I will, definitely. Eat less and less each day. Get smaller and smaller and smaller. and disappear forever. Goodnight everyone. Rydw i'n caru ti, Kiki xx
Ana Mail Day So, I ordered some supplements and a new scale last weekend & they arrived last Friday. (I've been meaning to update but life is kinda busy.) It was good and bad.  Good because I got some HydroxyCut, cayenne pepper capsules, and green coffee bean pills. It was terrible because my old dial scale was apparently 7 pounds off.  In the wrong direction.  So I'm officially a fucking whale but it's okay because that just lights a fire inside me (or maybe it's just that cayenne pepper) to starve on.  I researched HydroxyCut and found some alarming information but, fuck it, I'm desperate to drop pounds as quickly as possible. I took it with a tall glass of water and made myself a spinach salad.  -1 cup of baby spinach (12 calories)  -1/2 cup of peeled cucumber (8 calories) -1/4 cup of veggie cottage cheese (48 calories)  Total: 68 calories.  I love this Hood veggie cottage cheese. I love cheese to begin with but 1/4 cup has less calories than my favorite light dressing and is 200x more filling.  ---------- So, here we are, 6 days later & 5.4 pounds lighter! Not too shabby, considering I haven't been restricting below 1,000 calories a day.
Okay, so this isn't my first time with an ED. I am a "recovered" anorexic with purging tendencies, who is now at a healthy weight and discharged from inpatient and outpatient services. I am 19, female and from the UK, other details will follow when contacted. I'll give tips/help and am looking for someone to vent to/encourage me. Let's be friends! Contact me:  Kik is @ bbabykitten vent is @ pppeachesxx snapchat is @ crowleysprincess tumblr @ minicattt.tumblr.com
But to anyone who is truly pro anorexia, and not just on here because they are lonely in their ED'S, please read this. First off, let me say what I'm sure you have heard a million times but are to "determined" to actually accept; having anorexia will not make you happy. You will be just as unhappy as a bulimic or a binge eater or anyone else who has used food as a way to cope with the shit that has happened to them. Im not going to use flowery language to describe this, because eating disorders are ugly and horrible to endure. For the few girls on here saying "oh but I just want to lose weight SO BAD, I JUST WANT TO BE SKINNY" I'm sorry, but get the fuck over yourself. If you are not already too sick to fight, FUCKING FIGHT! Don't just lie down and let your 'disordered thoughts' send you to the slaughter house. I am pretty sure the vast majority of people on here are not anorexic, but do suffer from some sort of eating disorder, and there is this very palpable vibe that anorexia is the 'coveted disease'. It suck just as much as any DISEASE. It is horrible and scary and lonely AND YOU WILL NEVER BE HAPPY WITH YOURSELF. I FELT JUST AS BAD ABOUT MYSELF AT 5'9 100 LBS AS I DID AT 130. I just needed to say this, as someone who has now been struggling for just over a year with a diagnosed anorexia, IT IS HELL, HELL, HELL. DO NOT talk yourself into some sugary fantasy about beautiful bones and feeling delicate and beautiful. It will never ever ever ever happen. Not because you wont be a bag of  "lovely, beautiful, graceful, PERFECT", bones. You will be, but you wont see it. You will see the same selfish, ugly, loud, evil, girl staring back in the mirror no matter how many pounds you starve away, and even if you recognize you are thin, you will come to the should-be obvious conclusion that, surprise, it doesn't change ANYTHING. So if you think there is a chance you dont really have an ED and are just on here because you think it sounds like a good way to fit into those true religions and get some attention, pull your head out of the clouds and FIGHT. You are worth it, but after the meat grinder experience of battling an eating disorder, that will be harder to recognize. And if you think you wont want to fight, you're wrong. You will, when you feel your body start to crumble and decay, you will wish you could be the strong, healthy, beautiful person you decided to destroy. But by the time you actually want to fight for your life (because your great little eating disorder will fucking KILL YOU) you won't be able to see two feet in front of you, you won't be able to make the decision to recover, not easily, not with out unimaginable pain. You will waste years of your life for no reason. Please, if you can, turn back now. I am so sick of girls just rolling over and giving into negative thoughts and allowing them to metastasize into anorexia and bulimia and binge eating disorder and every-other manner of hell we practice upon ourselves. It is not worth it. I promise.
﻿10 day diet June 7, 2018caty So I found this diet, currently I am on day 6, and it’s been going really well! I have lost 2 lbs so I am down to 107. I also workout a ton which def helped. This one is great because it helps me not to binge. Y’all should try it!! Here’s the layout: ✦ day one: fast ✦ day two: 200 cal ✦ day three: 250 cal ✦ day four: 300 cal ✦ day five: 350 cal ✦ day six: 400 cal ✦ day seven: 450 cal ✦ day eight: 500 cal ✦ day nine: mono ✦ day ten: 500 cal Mono means you can only eat one food all day. I think I am going to do soup or cereal. No cal limit on it but just one food. It also gives me motivation because I can eat more the next day. If you know you have really bad cravings for a specific food, save that for your mono day. Remember to exercise at least an hour a day. A meal plan really helps. Should I do a meal plan post soon? Stay strong and starve on my lovelies! ❥ Caty

LOOKING FOR HELP?   Um..hey everyone. I'm new here and don't know much, I came here in hopes of getting some support on my endeavor to lose. I used to be really skinny when I first came to America, however life here became very stressful and busy that when I entered high school I gained a great amount of weight. I also went into a bit of depression and became extremely introverted and still am. I'm 17 now and entering my second year in college, I tried dieting as was suggested, before than I weighted 132lbs and only lost 4lbs and was extremely disappointed. I despise everything about my body, especially my legs and thighs. I'm now 128lbs and hope to get to 108lbs of possible. I would extremely appreciate any motivation, ideas, and tips that anyone can offer. I also hope to possibly get a pen-pal who can encourage me when things get tough as well as keep me in check. I would also love to do the same, we could encourage and help each other. Please let me know if anyone's interested. If anyone's interested in being pen-pals please msg: Email-Winterz.18.lost@gmail.com Kik-gothique829

The biggest I've been was 144 And i am now 124 My goal weight is 100-105 maybe 95 I'm really looking for friends who know what I'm going through cause none of my friends understand me It'd be nice to seem normal ya know~
Body Checks photo pile It is bloody hot in England today: 36* I'm at home, keeping an eye on an elderly relative and my pet rabbit who is pretty fluffy. So for all of 5 minutes, I was in the garden doing some body check photos (wearing summer clothes). My face has been deliberately left out, to keep some anonymity. *There are more photos but internet on my fone has gone to crap, so I'll save just these for now BMI today is 17.7.
﻿(if you want to view categories, click the arrow and the word the second time it appears. for example, there is lifestyle with an arrow, so click the arrow and it will drop down another lifestyle- click the second one.) It’s 2018, and the media hates us. Type in pro ana blog, and half the results is shaming us for not eating, for having these blogs. Plus, most of the pro ana blogs left are from, like, 2014. I was tired of going through half-finished, out-of-date blogs, so I made my own. i support recovery, but am not in it myself. My name is Caty. I’m 16, and I live in the United States. If you want to become ana buddies, or join a group chat, my kik is catyspacen. I’m 5’5, my starting weight was 125 lbs, my goal weight is 100 lbs, and my ultimate goal weight is 88 lbs. Currently, I am 109 (March 30 2019). Pro ana is not a religion here- just a lifestyle. I’m not trying to teach you to have an eating disorder, this is merely a refuge. It’s that little voice inside our head that we can’t seem to shake, but at least we don’t have to do it alone. So welcome, love you lots. Remember, calories are the enemy. You have control, you barely eat, and nothing tastes as good as skinny feels. Saying no to food is saying yes to skinny. But also, we are here to be skinny, NOT dead or hospitalized. And no one must EVER find out. ❥ Caty
Water Fast for Life Hello Guys I'm starting a Water Fast 1 November and I'm looking for a Fasting Buddy. Just someone to motivate you when times are tough. I really can do with someone to just remind me, what I am aiming for, when I need to hear it. Its true you cant tell someone you are Fasting.. cos it doesn't work. All I get is "you don't need to diet", "why do you want to kill yourself", "your metabolism will slow down", "Only fast for 3 days" etc etc etc, the list can go on and on. So support and understand amongst my Friends is not available - so on line I go. I don't have a time frame like 30 days or so... But my guess is, it would be longer than 30 days!  Even if you are not planning on Fasting that long... it would just be nice to know that you there. Reasons for Fasting... weight loss is a very big reason, but even so - its comes 2nd. My first reason is Colon bases... mine is screwed, along with my stomach lining and digestive and elimination track. Food does actually kill me. I'm hoping the Fast can cure that.  So here goes nothing! Love ya all! x
She ridicules your body and it's size, She spills out all of these ridiculous lies. Nothing that she's saying, Matches with your weighing. You're tiny, so frail and weak, You can barely even speak. Collapsing, fainting, crying, The truth is that you're dying. You scream and beg for treatments, But refusal is quite frequent. Your weight just keeps on dropping, You show no signs of stopping. It's not your fault you're ill, You're cure might be a pill. Or hard work and support, A hospital admission, not short. Three months you were there, Tube fed, but lots of love and care. Some beautiful and inspiring nurses, To help remove those curses. The ones that trapped you for years, Unravelling all of your fears. You're healing, you are healing, You finally have some feeling. It's possible to recover, A new you, you'll discover. I promise you'll be okay, Anorexia won't get her way.
