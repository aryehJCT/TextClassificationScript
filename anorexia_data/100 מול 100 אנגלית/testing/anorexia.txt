I have suffered from an eating disorder and I am currently recovered although I think it never really goes away; it will always linger around and will strike when stress arises. I notice in times of stress that I start paying more attention to my diet because it is still one of the things i do have control over. Even in times when there isnt stress in my life,I am still not able to eat a whole mars bar (too scary), and when I am angry with myself I still punish myself with not eating. Sometimes I wonder whether I need the control not because the things in my life are out of my control, but because I am out of control internally and I am not feeling balanced emotionally. It is fascinating to see how many people are actually suffering from disordered eating. I see more and more people in my environment with disordered eating behaviours and quilt feelings about eating. I think anorexia is in some cases a reaction to the other extreme, obesity. Both caused by either a lack of control in life or a lonely empty feeling that is caused by a society of having to achieve and be perfect. I am trying to make something positive out of my experience by giving a workshop to teenage girls. I have done the `Body think` training of the Butterfly Foundation in order to educate teenagers about positive body image. I believe a positive body image will prevent emotional imbalances from becoming dangerous eating disorders.
Today was mentally horrible but I restricted to 70 calories! So today I had a whole bunch of issues with 2 of the guys I'm talking to. I made it very clear that I didn't want a relationship but for whatever reason they both decided to have a meltdown about that today and I'm pretty sure I basically lost them both. Because of this happening I stayed in my room most of the day and slept after working out for about an hour! So the only thing I had today was tea(0) and coffee(35) for breakfast and then a plain rice cake(35) for dinner! I also lost 1.4 pounds so I'm completely happy I don't even care about anything else that happened!!!
aaaahhhh well today was a ok day. Not to much drama just here feeling lonley as myself. I ate 800 worth of calories im still a little pissed off at myself but at leats its not that much as the other daya but still. I went on a long long walk so maybe burned half of it. Right now i know for a fact im going to fast tomorrow i hate my body i saw myself today and i hate it just seeing me makes me sad and sick im a cow aaahhh fuck my life i hate myself why am i a fat ass well im going to pop some laxitive to feel better oh well. lets see how it goes tomorrow with my fast i dont want to eat ahhh wish me luck
Day 2 veggies!!! Aka fruit lol I am an idiot for work today I packed a bunch of fruit.... On veggie day lol! Just remembered now and it's abit too late to go back.. Oh well whatever I'll just have fruit at work l and have veg when I get home tonight. I didn't have time this morning to get a bowl of soup so i wont have anything but fruit which is ok, I'll just have it when I get home for dinner I guess.  So guess what.. My boss bought fish & chips last night for the staff coz we work til 9pm and I had some argh, but u know what I'm not gonna count it as a cheat, as long as I can get right back up again, which I did, ill b ok, & that doesn't mean I'll do it all the time either. Beau is so over it already lol that's fine by me, it's not like I expected him to last he had take out last night and stuffed his face with a few chocolates at work, oh well! As long as we don't have it in the house I guess I'll get over it.  TBH last night after I had the fish & chips my boss got I tried to purge, didn't really work!! I stopped and thought wtf am I doing!!?? I can't start that again... Right???  It's so damn cold! I just wanna b home in bed, I really can't wait until tomorrow is over so my wknd can begin:-)  I got really annoyed with B last night coz I was kinda looking forward to spending the wknd with him and I told him that all week until last night he decides to make plans for ppl to come round,& not any ppl a person in particular that I'm not really a fan of. His so into drugs it's not funny, I mean he can b a really nice guy and all without that but noooo... & he just influenced beau to do it too, I don't wanna sound like a bitch but beau doesn't really do any of that anymore but whenever ..Friend... Is around beau gets into it and it just frustrates me. Sorry bout the rant. Off to work I go!
﻿the thin commandments The thin commandments must be followed at all costs. They are the foundation to our skinny lifestyle, they keep us from failing, they keep us motivated. Read and re read these every single day. Memorize them, whatever it takes. With them, you will not fail. 1. If you aren’t thin, you aren’t attractive. 2. Being thin is more important than being healthy. 3. You must buy clothes, cut your hair, take laxatives, starve yourself, do anything to make yourself look skinnier. 4. You shall not eat without feeling guilty. 5. You shall not eat fattening food without punishing oneself afterwards. 6. You shall count calories and restrict intake accordingly. 7. What the scale says is the most important thing. 8. Losing weight is good, and gaining weight is bad. 9. You can never be too thin. 10. Being thin and not eating are signs of true will power and success. I know this is a short post, but def a necessity! ❥ Caty
Weigh in I just weighed myself for the first time in a while. I convinced myself that I was looking slightly smaller and that I would have lost at least a couple of lbs. I was wrong. I've gained back the 3lbs that I had lost and I'm back at the start. Back up to the highest weight I've ever been.  In that second I went from looking at myself and thinking I could see a slight difference, to seeing my stomach balloon before my eyes. I'm gigantic, how could I have ever convinced myself of anything else? I've been planning on having soup for lunch before I go to work, I even considered buying a wholemeal roll to go with the soup, but now the thought of eating anything seems ridiculous. Eating better seems to have caused me to gain weight, so clearly eating nothing is the only way I'll ever get down to an acceptable weight.
I got the 1am blues. Hello lovelies. It's 1am and I'm wide awake. I've been thinking about how I never bring up my own problems or fears with my friends or boyfriend, and if I do I follow it with a nervous laugh. I've told my boyfriend I'm terrified about failing this year, just in the jokey format of 'If I manage to pass this year I'll shake my own hand! hahaha'....You know, that thing we do when we want to express something serious but don't really want to discuss it but we do but we don't but we do but we don't but we aarrrghhhhhhh! I want to call my boyfriend and cry and tell him I'm not okay. I want to scream that I'm terrified that I'm going to fail my exams and that I'm falling right back into the pits of depression again. How can I tell him this when he still doesn't really know me? He doesn't know I've been cutting for 11 years - hell - he doesn't know I've ever cut. He doesn't know I have depression, how do you tell someone that? 'Hey, how're you? Good *kiss kiss* yeah well I'm not so good I thought I had control over my depression that I've been suffering with since I was 8 but after about 9 months of feeling fine it's all come crashing down around me and I just want to scream and cut and cry myself to sleep but I can't let anyone know what I'm going through but I want to tell you so badly. Oh and by the way I've had an eating disorder for 2 years but only now do I think it's 'peaking' if you will. Only now do I feel like I might actually get fucking skinny for once and I want you to worry and hold me...is that wrong? I don't know, I just feel fucking miserable. So yeah...that's how I feel today, do you want to go watch a film or something?' We've only been together a month and a half so I really can't unleash my crazy on him yet. He's made me more determined than ever to get thin though, for the simple reason that he's drop dead gorgeous. I see girls glare at me when we walk through town, my friends are jealous that I've got him and I'm determined to keep him! He's so lovely as well, just the perfect man really. He's tall, dark and handsome. He's got the perfect frame in my opinion, he's not skinny (hate that on guys) but he's flat, you know? Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, he's gorgeous and perfect and I'm a fat heffalump. I'm not seeing him until the end of the week and I'm determined to get my stomach a bit slimmer by then. I want to be sliding size 10 jeans over my toned ass at the end of may. Hear that fat?! You're being EVICTED! Get the hell off my bones! Sorry for the randomness of this post and the last one, it's been a weird time. My mood has been flying around between extremes. Extreme stress, extreme motivation, extreme happiness, extreme depression, extremely overwhelmed, calm, extreme stress....you get the idea. Anyway, it's 1:06am now and I'm going to try and sleep but I have so much coffee in my system I doubt that'll happeeennnnn. Good night skinny lovelies :) Rydw i'n caru ti, Kiki xxx
Looking for a supportive ana group <3 Hiya everyone! Ive attempted ana in the past but had very little willpower and simply couldnt motivate myself to do it, as a result i currently weigh 62kg (136lb) at 174cm tall (5"8) which makes my bmi 20. Im 18 years old and looking for strong willed and friendly people that can help support me in my journey and in return i can help support them. Im specifically looking for group diets and fasting, group workouts, and group weight checks with active members. If this sounds like you pretty please message me! lots of love <3
So obviously the US and Australia differ greatly in food and I thought a thread where Aussies could share low cal foods would be good. I'll start! All of these can be found at Woolworth's! I bulk buy the fish from Costco. Also Curly Wurly's I get from convenient stores because Woolies didn't have them -___- Here is my list: Bird's Eye Crumbed Hoki Fish Fillet 2 fillets = 293 calories Uncle Ben's Express Single Server Rice (Fried rice/Mexican rice) 1 bag = 195 calories Curly Wurly 1 bar = 119 calories Hansells Creamy Rice (Vanilla) 1 pot = 117 calories Jumpy's Chicken Flavoured snack things 1 bag = 92 calories Woolworth's Organic Macro Apple Puree  1 pot = 54 calories (!!!!!) Aeroplane Jelly Lite (assorted flavours, in my opinion peach iced tea is the best) 250ml = 7 calories  Woolworth's brand Garlic Bread 1 slice = 88 calories Health Attack Cripsy Fruits freeze dried fruits (apple is the best) 1 bag = 39 calories Kirk's Sugar Free Lemonade, Pub Squash and Creaming Soda 1 can = 2.2 calories Foster's Clark Custard Cups 1 cup = 132 calories Bird's Eye Potato Waffles 1 waffle = 105 calories Dorito's Salsa - Mild 40g =  13 calories Calciyum Strawverry Yogurt  1 pouch = 100 calories Diet Rite Apple Raspberry Cordial  1L diluted = approx 30 calories (depends how strong you like your cordial) SUBWAY https://www.subway.com.au/Menu Use this to calculate the total in your sub! I get a 6 inch white bread with ham, lettuc, olives and cheddar, it comes to 288.70 calories! Lastly for people from Adelaide, Australia: Cucina Cibo pasta meals available at Woolworths - the largest portion of delicious lasagna is 490 calories. The wide ribbon pasta with beef ragu is only 376 calories and it a massive serve of pasta! Other Aussies feel free to add your finds!
Help. I miss the old Blogger, not that that matters, but these just don't feel like my posts anymore! I can gradually feel myself getting fatter day by day, hour my hour. And I'm doing nothing to stop it! I haven't been to the gym in god knows how long, and I just keep making myself believe that sex will burn it off, and weed will keep my metabolism burning at an intense rate, and food and moderation is the key! When it isn't! It's the devil! Food is making me fat, and moderation, should be starvation. And I need to regain control! I am in such a depressive stage and I wish I could get back to my 90lb self that I was little until 5 years ago.  Skinny, Happy.  And skinny.  That was all that mattered back then.  Now I am fat.  And unhappy. I need you guys. I need to get out of my rut. Please help me I know I can do this. I just need guidance xxx

Its hard I fasted for a total of 66hours drank soo much water and have lost 1.6lbs :) I know I could've lost more but I weighed after I ate instead of before, mainly because my scales are messed up and keep messing with me saying 160lbs 165lbs until it finally showed me 170lbs like 10 times yesterday... Aghh its hard my boyfriend is like why aren't you eating?  I said I ate at work and hes obviously shocked Im handling 5mins without stuffing my face he says hes worried...?  Like how am I supposed to do this if I cant even last 3days without someone forcing me to eat.... And I still haven't started my course and im still fat and im so annoyed I said I wouldn't allow myself and look at me now fat face chest belly bums & legs I hate it all . I did buy my B6 & B12 though they are the only thing keeping me awake I want to sleep but instead im gonna do pilates and jumping jacks and crunches until 10pm so I can shower and hide my exercise evidence before the boyfriend gets home @ 11pm. I was reading blogs I followed before and so much has changed most of you are gone some have sadly passed...but the ones that are still here and still going you are my motivation everyday and I will get down to my GW. No matter what.
Tips: 1) It takes 12 hours before your body starts feeding on its own fat. So don’t eat before 7am and after 6pm … your giving yourself a 13 hour fast. 2) If your craving something, grab a glass of water and count to 50. If that doesn’t work, brush your teeth. 3) Feeling hungry… chew some sugar free gum 4) Drink tea, it suppress your appetite (honestly, I couldn’t survive without it) 5) Plain celery is your best friend because you end up burning calories as you chew. 6) Use small plates, it tricks your body into thinking its going to get more. 7) Drink water. Especially before, during and after each meal, it makes your fuller without adding extra calories. 8) If you must go out somewhere, take only the bare minimum amount of money so you cant buy food. 9) Always leave something on your plate, it will stop you compulsively finishing of your meal. 10) When you have a strong craving, go as far away from the kitchen. Lock yourself in your room for an hour and the craving will be gone.
aand its gone.. i can't fucking eat anymore. i'm too fucking fat. at least.. thats what she tells me... wow, i'm tracking myself. this is a good sign. here we go. Me: it'll be okay if i eat some chocolate and some of these fatty cracker things. im way below the normal amount of food anyway, i couldnt have gone above 1000 calories today. Her: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?????? Me: i'm enjoying this chocolate. it's yum. you didnt let me enjoy chocolate at christmas time. Her: because your FAT, and nothings changed! you've already gone over the limit today!! Me: it's okay, everyone has off days. Her: you can't afford to have off days, you FUCKING idiot, your birthday is in two weeks! Me: i've lost a kilo already! Her: one measly kilo, you're not even at your starting weight in year 9 yet. you're fucking fat. on your 18th everyones going to think your a fat cow compared to your 16th. and you wont want to look at the photos, just like after valedictory. you fucking whale. Me: ...*stumped*..... Her: good. you're not losing this fast enough, you've got to be at LEAST 52 kilos by your birthday weekend. no more eating. Me: you're right, it's the only way. breakfast though, it'll keep my metabolism up. Her: *sigh* you're right i guess. ONE weetbix. your limit is now 100 calories a day. Me: i can take this. i will be skinny. Her: yes you can! let's do this, let's get you gorgeous. ... Me: what will I do about tonight? Her: just stay up until you get hungry, then you can go to bed. that's the best we can do right now. Me: ok. starting tomorrow, i'll be strong. ... i can't stop listening.

Hey darlings. And by darlings I mean Bella I think you're the only one who reads this. I'm having a bit of a crisis but I'm back from up North now. I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and I haven't been taking the new antidepressants he gave me because a massive side effect was weight gain. And I've gone so downhill, and I feel like shit and I wrote a list of all the things I need to say to him, everything I feel and the biggest things that scare me but I don't know if I'm brave enough to give it to him. I'm too shy, I just let my doctor talk and lie and pretend I take my meds when I don't and I want help so bad but I'm so scared. Sorry it a self obsessed rant. I hope you're okay. 
It's Just Another Obsession I have had a fitbit for all of two weeks and I am absolutely obsessed. I'm obsessed with logging my food and activities, and making sure that I hit those goals. Always. It's just another kind of obsession.  It's not destructive in any way however, as I am following pretty closely to maintain a 500 cal deficit per day to lose 1kg a week. I have been allowing myself to eat sometimes as much as 1700 calories a day, but then picking that up with more exercise. I must admit, I do feel good - even if it's taking fucking ages to get skinny. When I say ages, I mean fucking ages. I am hovering around high 67's. I need to take an accurate weight tomorrow, cuz I got a bit drunk on Friday which fucks with hydration levels etc. I'm hoping I'm not enormously fat.  Anyway, I do have faith in what I am doing... And most importantly, I am fucking looking after myself.  Still vegan.  FP
How to cut calories in everyday baking This isn't so much a recipe, but more a tip to apply with any recipe. Queenie asked me if I had any low-calorie cake recipes, and while I don't, I do have experience testing to see what's the best balance between fat content and final product. First of all, never cut all the fat from a cake! It's crucial to have some fat content to produce a proper texture. I'm going to fill you all in on my favourite ways to cut calories in cakes, and baking in general. Keep at least an egg yolk or a little oil in there - I prefer to use a low-fat margarine, with fat-free milk, fat-free egg replacer, and low-calorie sweetener. Skim Milk This is an obvious one. Just replace equal amounts full-fat milk with skim milk, and you'll cut calories. Low-Fat Margarine Spreads The lowest calorie one that I've been able to find is Weight Watcher's Canola Spread, which has 300 less calories per 125g than butter. I use this in my baking all the time, and have had no issues. I've tried using Applesauce, but it tends to give cakes a gummy, unpleasant, chewy texture. Artificial/Low Calorie Sweetener Again, an obvious one. Cutting a cup of sugar in favor of Splenda saves 700 calories! Vegan Egg Replacer For some reason, I have much better results with this than with egg whites. I use Orgran No Egg. One teaspoon is equal to one egg, but only 9 calories. In a two-egg recipe, this cuts 130 calories. Diet Soda This is not a method I'd recommend, but it works in a pinch. Get a box of cake mix (low-sugar is best, for lower calories) and mix it up with a can of diet soda. These tend to turn out with the same unpleasant texture as using applesauce, but not everyone minds. Cake Flour This doesn't cut calories, but it's just a handy tip. Especially when you're cutting fat from a cake, Cake Flour will produce a more tender cake, as it has a different protein content. It's worth getting if you can find it, or you can find recipes for making your own (like self-raising flour). I hope that these help you guys with your baking endeavors! Happy Eating! xxBella
Fml Need to get some ideas for a diet, that actually works unlike the soup diet I just did, been so good yet nothing happened I'm still the same fat weight as I was two weeks ago!  Starting to think I Should just eat fruit and veg an have a salad every night for dinner an a proper meal at lunch time like a sandwich or something!!! Blahhhh
FATFATFATFAT   Hey everyone, you can call me Charlotte. I've gained a ridiculous amount of weight recently and I'm trying to lose it all again, so I would really appreciate any support/tips/people to talk to! I'm 5'8" and my lowest weight was 104 pounds, but my weight is currently fluctuating between 118 and 122 pounds, and I feel huge. My current goal is to get back down to 104 pounds. I might want to lose more weight after that, but I'm not sure what my ultimate goal weight is yet. I've just started fasting, so hopefully that helps me reach my goal. Good luck everybody! I'd love somebody to talk to.
WEDNESDAY 24TH JULY. 4.37pm I MISS MY BONEY REYNAUDS (SP) SYNDROME FKING LEGS.  My legs hurt now anyway and Im way fatter so I might as well lose weight. I am always in pain anyway.  Ate so much already today... half a smoothie (banana,apple,milk,turmeric) approx 150kcals. Bowl of soup w/half a slice of brown bread and no butter thankfully... 300kcals ? Coke zero- 2kcals 50g turnip and 1 bite chicken- 70 kcals 522 KCALS Well 522kcals is still restricting and I can just eat a 100 kcalorie snack later but nothing is good enough anyway. Im huge at the minute. Cant even weigh myself as it is embarrassing. I look so fat. My waist says under 26 inches but that's not even small or that small anyway when I am comparing my waist to under 23inches before... it is better than 30 inches which was hell..... nothing is good enough anyway!! I wish I puked the soup up in one way...hmm... met my friend today anyway and got some cleaning and mopping done. Going to nap and watch TV. Still cant be arsed starting back work fully but maybe tomorrow or Friday.... I need some time off.... plus the pay is poop.   Maybe will do a quick hula hoop workout later but no dumbells as my body aches so much. LOL if I watch German Anorexia films then it is a form of study for the Masters I don't even want to do at the minute... it is self centred... i want to be alone to starve... but i have my reasons... people have bullied me and pissed me off so much so it's not narcissism , it is moreso retreat and depression and alienation...
Dear my body; I hate you. I really do. Thighs, please lose all unecessary baggage. Butt, please unload all of the junk from your trunk. Stomach, please oh please discard all of that fat that is so obviously there. Body, please become as perfect as the bodies of the women that walk down the Victoria's Secret runways, Or become as perfect as those bodies I see on thinspiration sites. Body, please became one that would be seen on a thinspiration site. That is all I have to say to you. Become perfect. Yours sincerely, Anafly xxx
Returning from the alps! Hello lovelies! Skiing was so much fun! I'm getting so much better, my trainer picked me to race for our Uni in one of the events! I was so fucking stoked :D It was wonderful. Thanks for all the comments on all my recent posts, sorry I haven't gotten round to replying, my life is so so so busy right now but I promise in my next post I'll reply to you beautiful ladies :) I've missed you all! I was down 5lbs when I got back from skiing which was awesome, except my mind hasn't accepted that I'm not doing 7 hours worth of exercise a day anymore. I've been eating like a pig for a week and now I'm too scared to weigh. I'm becoming scared of food too. Don't get me wrong, I've had an ED for almost 3 years but I've never been afraid of food. I don't know why. I avoided it, binged on it, ate normally, ate nothing, but was never afraid. Now I'm afraid. Really fucking afraid. Every time I allow myself to eat something it turns into a binge. I can't just have a normal sized meal anymore, I keep going and it's scaring me. Today for example, I ate greek yoghurt with banana for breakfast and decided to fast the rest of the day. I got hungry around 12pm but resisted until I couldn't concentrate on my work. I decided to allow myself half a sandwich so I could write my essay properly. I make the sandwich and eat it. Then 2 hot cross buns come out, I eat one while the other one is toasting. Then a packet of crisps Then 3 lines of galaxy chocolate. Then I stop, have a freak out and continue to write my essay. What the hell?? I've never had this before, I've heard of other people having this problem but I've never been like this. If I binge it's always kind of 'planned' you know? Never just mindless 'I'll have one sandwich.....nomonomnomnom on everything in sight' kind of...loss of control. I'm scared to eat now, which is a good thing I guess because I'm huge. I cut today as well. I've been trying so hard to stop but I swear this time is so much harder than last time. I need some sleep. Rydw i'n caru ti, Kiki xx
Doctor’s Appointment Update I went to the doctor’s yesterday and wasn’t able to update and tell anyone how it went. So here it goes. I got weighed and the lady who was weighing me wouldn’t let me see the number on the scale. Which really bothered me. Then I had to wait in a small room for twenty minutes while the doctors talked about random stuff. Then I had to fill out an idiotic survey, then I had to wait even longer while they went over the answers. Then they came back and asked me the same questions in person at least four different times. And after all of that, there wasn’t even anything wrong with me! What the actual fuck. So I got to leave on these conditions: My mom MAKES a smoothie for me every morning and she packs my lunch. It says nothing about me having to eat the lunch or drink the smoothie. Honestly, you’d think that doctors would have enough brain cells to put that on their little sheet. Of course, when mom made me the smoothie this morning, I didn’t drink it. Apparently they think that if they talk to me sternly and write things on paper it will cure me. You can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped, and I most certainly don’t want to be helped. I am so close to my goal weight, I weighed in at 108.7 pounds this morning. No doctor is going to take the joy of achieving that beautiful number 80 away from me. Pardon my French, but fuck them. ~Robin
Stomach Issues Have you ever laid down on your back and traced your hip bones and ribs? I do it all the time. I just wish that when I stood up I was able to do the same thing. I want those prominent hip bones, that caved in stomach, that tight skin over my ribs, those raised collar bones. It’s not fair. I have them when I lay down, and I want them when I stand up. I’m 108.7, a new low, but I’m not really able to enjoy it because it’s just not low enough. I have decided to stop eating anything I have not prepared myself and since I am not at home for most of the day, this means only dinner. Which will be small and controlled. ~Robin ❤
the holidays god. we all hate them. you know you do, dont deny it. the food. the family. the people. the FAT. UGH! so obviously. im on vacation. two weeks. two weeks without structure, school, and starvation. since im home so much i need to eat more to satisfy my family’s suspicions. it sucks. and now, im writting to you wonderful people who read my blog from my aunts house. there are TOO MANY PEOPLE HERE! its me, my sister, my brother, my mom, my dad, my grandma, aunt 1, uncle 1, aunt 2, uncle 2, cousin 1, cousin 1’s husband, and their kid (second cousin).yeah. i managed not to eat too much for most of the day. and then desert came and aunt 2 brought a whole platter full of different types of cookies and there was aunt 1’s toffe brittle, and just so many delicious sugary things. i caved, i had to have eaten like 8 cookies and 3 square inches of toffee brittle. i feel FREAKING DISGUCTING. i want to go in the bathroom and cry my eyes out. i hate feeling this full. i hate it so much. iv been trying to exercise by bouncing my legs and walking around, but im pretty sure its not working. i guess i just need a little support right now. ALSO. i made a post on whyeat.net about how researchers believe that anorexia is linked to wanting to stay a child, and im starting to agree with that more and more. my seconds cousin got all these presents and everyone was paying attention to him and i felt jealous. of a freaking five year old! i wanted to be the center of everyones attention. i wanted everyone to be taking my picture. i wanted all the presents. these days everyone just gets me like 15 bucks and then theyre done with me. its not fair. either that or i want to fade away. disappear so im just a spectator. im free to leave whenever i want to but i can always come back and enjoy the company thats close by. i just want this to end. i hate holidays.
No one knows the full story. Hello lovelies. I'm having a bit of an...I don't want to say epiphany but that's all I can describe it as. I've been thinking a lot lately about why and how I fell into this world, the world of ED. There hasn't been a direct trigger that has thrown me face first into this state of mind. I've had potential triggers, if that makes sense. I've had a fair few moments of trauma in my life which, should they had been directly followed by an ED I would understand but...they haven't. I did start cutting as a direct result of something. That I understand. But this? Seemingly out of the blue? That I don't. I stopped cutting about 2 years ago. It was so hard. It was like voluntarily shutting out a friend who knows exactly what to say to make you feel better, who has all the right words, all the right emotions, all the right blades. I'm wondering if I've subconsciously switched coping mechanisms. I used to cut when things went wrong, even little things, even nothing sometimes. I just found it comforting, like snuggling up under a blanket where nothing could hurt me. Nothing could hurt me except me, and I did just that. Is it possible that after almost a year of mental stability that I've fallen back? Is it possible that, without any direct trigger, I need my security blanket again? I can't use the old security blanket though, people recognize that one from when I curled up under it before. If I dug it out of the attic they'd know exactly what I was doing. I needed a new blanket that no one would suspect, and I got one. A brand-spanking new security blanket under which no one knows what I am doing. They just see a blanket, it's like my own secret world. My new friend. Did you ever sit up in bed and pull the duvet over your head and read or write or just be? No one knew what you were doing under there except you. Little do they know we're not reading or writing anymore, we're striving for something much more evident, something much more beautiful. We're all just writing under our duvets, we're all huddled under our security blankets. Why were we chosen? Why do we have to cope in such destructive ways? Why can't we just call up our friends and cry while eating ice cream? Why do we hide our sadness? Why can't we just talk about it? To someone, anyone... My problem now is, I'm feeling colder. I think I might need another blanket. I'm telling you, you're the only one who understands, you know that? It's difficult being so happy go lucky all the time. It's hard, it's all so hard. I don't want to break. Don't let me get the old blanket down, please don't. I can't cope on my own. I can't. I'm sorry for all this.. Rydw i'n caru ti, Kiki xx
"You don't have to be invisible to disappear." In the months since I last posted, my support team has basically tripled in size. For a long time, it’s been my GP, dietitian, and psychologist. Now, since my NDIS plan has come into effect, I also have two support workers, a support coordinator, a drug & alcohol counselor, and an occupational therapist. The only day that I don’t have any appointments is Sunday. I see one support worker Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturday. The second one, who I only met a couple of weeks ago, I see Mondays and Thursdays. They’re there to mostly have a chat, help out with issues that might be bothering me, and day-to-day things. I see my GP and dietitian every other Tuesday, and my psychologist on alternate weeks. I see the drug & alcohol counselor every few weeks, to try to come up with coping mechanisms to cut back on drinking. My support coordinator basically runs things, but I don’t see him much, and the occupational therapist is every month or two (basically to set goals and create more routine in my days). The organization my support team are from run groups during the week. I’m supposed to try to get to them once or twice a month, but I haven’t yet (when I do, it’ll probably be the exercise oriented ones). They also do BBQs each Saturday, which I try to get to every 4-6 weeks. A few of the people there I already know pretty well from when I was living at the SRS, so that makes it easier to be around so many people. I’m still too nervous to eat at the BBQ, between eating in front of others and whipping out my scales like a weirdo, but my Support Worker buys me a coffee on the way. Since I’ve always been so isolated, I’ve never really had to deal with people pressuring me to eat. My family would ask if I’d like to try what they were cooking, and obviously wanted me to eat, but accept it when I declined. At the BBQ, even when none of them know explicitly about the ED, at least half a dozen people will ask “have you had something to eat?”, “aren’t you having lunch?”, “are you sure you don’t want something?” Even if I was hungry and the food smells good, I’d rather wait until I get home and cook a low-fat sausage in a dry pan and eat it in wholemeal, instead of a fatty budget sausage cooked in oil and put in white bread. None of it’s helping much at the moment, but it’s nice to have the extra support and know that, most days, there’ll be someone around if I need to talk. A few weeks ago, I slammed headfirst into a massive ED trigger. I won’t go into detail, because I don’t want to trigger anyone else with it. In the space of a few days, I made after hours crisis calls to my support worker, dietitian, The Butterfly Foundation (which I could unfortunately not get through to), Lifeline, and an emergency GP appointment. Those who know me, know that it takes a lot for me to actually pick up the phone, or to go and talk to a doctor I’ve never met before. I’ve had to be more cautious with food, with only the safest of safe foods on the menu to avoid another breakdown. I’m stocked up on fruits (currently apples, mandarins, kiwis, strawberries, watermelon and cantaloupe), yoghurt, crispbread, multigrain bread, and boiled eggs. If I want a main meal, I’ve got veggie soups and stews in the freezer, and I’ve always got things to make baked potatoes around (usually a little low-fat cheddar, garlic, and 97% fat-free shortcut bacon). One of my favorites is a light version of potato latke - a medium low carb potato, shredded and mixed with No Egg egg replacer, and cooked in a couple of teaspoons of butter. Even though I use a little butter, it still works out to under 200 cal. I’m also partial to chicken cooked in Mexican seasoning, to have with salad in either a wrap or a couple of crunchy taco shells. And with winter hitting hard, hot chocolates (45 cal) are flowing in abundance. It’s not 100% full proof. Especially if I’m drinking, my food choices vary (not so much by calories, but different options that aren’t necessarily as safe). On the plus side, I’m also drinking less, even though it’s mostly because of the calories. Last year, I consumed a total of 136,700 calories in alcohol alone. That translates to 17.75kg (39 lbs) extra on the scale that I could’ve lost if I didn’t drink. My dietitian is concerned that I’ve barely been getting any protein. I’ve been averaging 20g a day, and she wants me to get up to at least 40g. I’ve been trying to add in things like more yoghurt, boiled eggs, and nibbling on cashews instead of crispbread, but I still struggle to even hit 30g. Since the Big Trigger, it’s back down to barely 20g. My weight’s slowly been dropping since cutting down on drinking in the past year, although it’s been stagnant because I’ve been drinking more again in the last three months, mostly due to a lot of traumaversaries at this time of year. Whether I’m drinking or not, my food calories average around 600, but alcohol can easily add an extra 1,000 in a day. Mum has since decided to move back to Geelong, after spending months looking around the state to figure out where she wants to go. Our relationship has definitely improved in the past 6 months, but it’s not without effort. We’ve started going for walks, to get me out of the house and to help with her health issues. About a month ago, we did the walking track at the beach (unfortunately I did not take photos). Then last week, we did the river walk (pictures below). I’m still not getting out much - the only other outings this year have been two birthday dinners - but hopefully between these walks, the BBQ, and trying to start some of the groups, that might improve. I’m also going to be looking at a couple of places this week, for the first time since the house was sold in August. I’d been looking a lot before that, but since Billy passed, I lost all motivation. Even though it’s never been an overly pleasant place, the refuge has become even more stressful and depressing in recent months, and I need to get out of here, especially after being here since October. So wish me luck! And I’m sorry I’ve been terrible at answering comments and emails. When I get them, I tell myself I’ll post an update the next day, but can’t find the energy to get out of bed and sit at my laptop. I know I say it every time, but I really will try to update more often. xxBella
Sorry seems to be the main word in my vocabulary... I'm back. I previously sort of recovered by myself unintentionally and I waited for ana to take me back. I've relapsed and now back with my lovely companion. I've missed her and you guys. There's so much to catch up on! I hope you guys don't mind having me back. It's going to take me some time to get back into the swing of things on here, I hope I don't dissapoint. Today's Intake: 483 Exercise: 493 Net: -10 I know this may sound bitter and twisted but I'm so glad that I'm back!!!! Lots and lots and lots and lots of undying love, Anafly xxx
On the road to skinny There was always a part of me that liked my body and hated the other part of me that hated my body. Now that part has gone. All of me hates my body. I'm sick of it. Sick of it. Fat, just go away, make it easier for me. Or maybe food, maybe you could go away. Temptation go away. How about all of it go away: the fat, the temptation and the food. Yeah sounds like a plan. Today I've already consumed a lot: breakfast: piece of bread with nutella, 2 pieces of toast with avocado and tomato. I blame it on holidays. Anyway that is all I plan on eating today until dinner and then I'll only consume a little bit. I will ignore all temptations. Then I will be back on track, I will be back on the horse riding under the sun on the road to skinny skinny skinny. But that's not all I want. As I travel this path to skinny skinny skinny I also want to gain attention, love and happiness. Even though I don't want people to notice what I'm doing to my body I also hope that eventually people will; but the fact that people may notice also scares me because I don't know what they'll do once they notice. It's all so confusing but now I don't care. I'm determined. My goal is set. That feeling in my stomach now, the feeling of being full, learn to hate it and steer clear from it. A full stomach = a fat stomach, fat thighs, a fat butt. Remember that now, that is vital information. Hopefully the next couple of days are easier, much easier. NO PIGGING OUT FOR ME!
﻿anafood: breakfast ideas Hey everyone! I’m doing an anafood series, which is basically just food ideas for anas. There might be something over 200, but most everything is under that. Enjoy! breakfast ✦ Green tea (0 cal) ✦ Small apple (70 cal) ✦ Honey Nut Cheerios w almond milk (1 cup cereal + ½ cup almond milk= 120 cal) ✦ Oatmeal, ¼ cup (75 cal) *depends on type of oats, how much you eat, and whether you add things to it. Always check nutrition labels ✦ Vegan pancakes- recipe link (100 cal per pancake) ✦ Egg cups- recipe link (40 cal per cup) Breakfast is easy to skip, which is why there’s only a few ideas listed. Stay strong and starve on my lovelies! ❥ Caty
So, I gave in and weighed myself. I know it's 10pm so I'm probably lighter than this normally, but it's still worse than I though. 161lbs. This is going to be my target plan and I need to stick to it.  Do any of you lovelies have any 'punishment' ideas for when you don't reach your targets? Fasting just doesn't work for me - I have to spend too much time awake! I would really appreciate your ideas :-) Anyway, here goes! Start weight (20/03): 161 26/03 - 158 2/04 - 155 9/04 - 152 16/04 - 149 23/04 - 146 30/04 - 143 7/05 - 140 14/05 - 137 21/05 - 134 28/05 - 131 4/06 - 128 11/06 - 125 18/06 - 122 25/06 - 119 2/07 - 116 9/07 - 113 16/07 - 110 23/07 - 107 30/07 - 104 - TARGET!! I was always happy at 107lbs. 104 would be perfect though :-) A long way to go and it's going to be a bloody awful journey, but I can do this. I have to. xxxx
Losing weight again I've lost 2.4lbs over the past 2 days. I'm still massively huge but at least now I know I have some control again. I won't let myself stay like this. I can be acceptable again. I know I should go to the gym today, I have hours until work so I do have the time. But being the socially awkward freak I am, I'm too scared to go alone, and my friend can't go with me until tomorrow. I should just go. I need to stop being so pathetic. I think I'll have soup for lunch, and then I don't know what to do in the evening. I have work at 5 so I could easily not eat before I go. But I know if I do that then I'll stuff my face during my break, working in a food shop is shit. I wish I worked in a clothes shop instead, so I'd spend my breaks really motivated rather than just really hungry. I also reallllllly need to tidy my room today, it's literally disgusting. I justify it by saying I'm hardly at home so it doesn't matter. But even the short time I'm in here now is making me feel ill looking at the mess. It can't be hygienic. Anyway I set myself 2 more goals for the rest of the week. To lose 4 lbs, 2 lbs at a time. If I can just control my fat ugly self then it would be easy. Hope you're all having a good day. I have missed everyone on this blog so much.
