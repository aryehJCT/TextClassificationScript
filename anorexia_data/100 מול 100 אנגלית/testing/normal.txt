Where have I gone? I have worked all my adult life helping kids avoid bullies. Ignore it. You are better than that. Tell someone. The bully has bigger issue, let's try to understand them. When you've trusted someone with all your faults and foibles, secrets and hopes and been as real as you can be: and they turn on you and treat you appallingly - that stings. When you are a kid. When you are an adult you go through loads of feelings, the whole range sometimes. When you are an adult with a mental health disorder it is all these things, plus you need to try and keep yourself safe. And when the good friend who dumped on you after 15 years of friendship, knowing what it would do to you as they have a very close relative with MH themselves? You can fill in the rest. I AM still blogging, but am starting afresh, hopefully somewhere where, "Dear Reader" she will leave me alone.

Henry VIII HENRY TUDOR Born: 28 June 1491 (Age 18) Occupation: King of England Lives: In lots of palaces all over London Hobbies and Interests: Jousting, hunting, dancing, reading, music, lay-dees Relationship status: It’s complicated What do we know about Henry VIII? Henry VIII is probably one of England’s most famous monarchs (another word for king or queen). When you mention his name, almost anyone can picture a bearded, round-bellied monarch in his feathered hat and finery.  They can probably also tell you that Henry had six wives. Was Henry fat? Henry was a very sporty young man when he became King at the age of 18 in 1509 following the death of his father, Henry VII.  He enjoyed hunting, often wearing out eight horses in one day, and also loved dancing, jousting and wrestling.  He was very tall for a man during the Tudor period.  Historians think he could have been around 6 foot 3. Unfortunately, Henry also had a huge appetite. When he was 44, his horse rolled on him during a jousting tournament, leaving his leg permanently damaged.  He wasn’t able to exercise anymore, but he kept eating, and as a consequence he got very fat.  By the end of his life he weighed about 20 stone and had a 52 inch waist. (That’s about the length of this fish) Did he have six wives? Henry did indeed have six wives.  But not all at the same time.  Even the King of England wasn’t allowed to do that. Introducing...the six wives of Henry VIII! So, what else do we know about Henry? Henry was born in 1491, the second son of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York.  Whilst his older brother Arthur was paraded around as the future heir, Henry lived a much more sheltered life and was a bit of a mummy's boy.  Growing up, Henry had a tutor who taught him languages, maths, music and poetry.  He also had a fool to entertain him when he got bored. DANCE FOOL ! Henry also had a whipping boy.  This was a servant employed purely to be whipped when Henry was naughty, because no one was allowed to hit the little prince. Hands up who wants that job? When Arthur died in 1502, at the age of 15, shortly followed by Elizabeth in 1503, King Henry VII went crazy with grief, while his son, young Prince Henry, was left feeling a tad unloved.  When Henry VIII became king he promptly reversed most of his father's policies and executed his favourite servants.  Daddy issues much? Henry was a very popular prince when he became king, known for his love of dancing and hunting. He also had an eye for the ladies and very quickly got special permission from the Pope to marry his brother's widow, Catherine of Aragon. Henry was obsessed with having a son and heir to succeed him.  When Catherine was only able to produce a daughter, Mary (which of course had nothing to do with Henry, or, y'know, maybe just bad luck), Henry started eyeing up one of Catherine's ladies-in-waiting, Anne Boleyn. (A lady-in-waiting was a bit like a personal assistant - they opened post, looked after the Queen's wardrobe and kept her up to date on all the latest gossip.) Unfortunately for Henry, being a Catholic meant he wasn't really allowed to get divorced. Since the Pope wouldn't let Henry divorce his wife, he threw his toys out the pram and set up his own church instead - the Church of England. Henry is quite famous for having founded the Church of England, but in reality it wasn't until his daughter Elizabeth I came to the throne that the church really began to take off.  All Henry really did was knock down lots of monastries and steal their gold. It was Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, who finally gave him the son he so badly wanted.  Edward VI was born in 1537 and Jane died from complications following the birth a few days later.  Henry always said that Jane was his favourite because she had given him a son, and he was buried next to her when he died on 28 January 1547 at the age of 55. Henry was also a very clever King.  He was good at maths, knew a lot about astronomy and was very interested in politics.  He was also very cultured - he read widely and kept a library of over 1000 books, as well as playing, and some say composing, music. However, he has also been described as an overgrown child who was prone to tantrums if he didn't get his own way.  This made him very scary as, more often than not, the King's temper tantrums resulted in someone getting their head chopped off. Why is he so famous? Henry was quite a colourful character.  Which is another way of saying he was off his rocker!  He also remembered for his six wives (not many men have that many) and for his role in breaking away from the Catholic church and founding the Church of England.  He was a physically dominant man whose image is instantly recognisable and lots of historians have spent a lot of time studying Henry's reign as King of England. Sound smart! "Henry VIII spent a week blubbering in public when he found out his fifth wife, Catherine Howard, had cheated on him." "Henry VIII executed more people per year than any other king or queen in English history - he had 330 people killed between 1532 and 1540!" "Some of the most important achievements of Henry VIII's reign include: the creation of the Church of England, bigging up the role of Parliament, joining Wales and Ireland with England, the arrival of lots of new and exciting art and literature and building A LOT of castles." Some other fun sources An interesting but fun website dedicated the Henry VIII and the Tudors The BBC history page on Henry VIII has some fun facts, as well as videos and games And finally, what else?

Loosing Sight.. At the beginning of 2017 I shared with you all about “The Day I Lost my Sight”. Through writing this about my blindness in my right eye due to my Juvenile Arthritis that began in my teenage years, many reached out to me and Kids Arthritis to share their stories and access support. During October 2017 I visited my Opthamologist, had some scans of my eyes and this was all fine, but the result wasn’t. Once again I was back in the big blue chair and on the screen were the images which had been taken. What happened next, changed my life.  On the screen, I saw the scan of the back of my eye and what was showing were some tiny ‘bubbles’ in the left eye (my seeing eye). These bubbles aren’t friendly bubbles, they’re Macular Degeneration. The look on the Opthamologist face said it all. Surprised, upset and unsure of how this could come about. All the medical treatments are supposed to prevent this from happening, but still it has occured. But you know what I did in that moment. I didn’t get angry or upset. I thought about the 1 in 1000 children in Australia living with Juvenile Arthritis. About how much pain they’re in right now and everyday, thinking they’re the only ones living like this. I also thought how much they need someone like me who can stand up for them living with Juvenile Arthritis and Kids Arthritis tosupport them and show them that it’s going to be ok. Medical professionals don’t know yet when my sight will disappear, but what I do know is that with your help we can ensure that more children living with Juvenile Arthritis, who could be going through this situation don’t need to do it alone.
Shampoo Troubles  One day on September1st 2009 Isabella Marie, an average girl who was very smart acted irrational for a few minutes in the shower. “There’s no more shampoo!” she shrieked. So she got out of the shower, put on her robe and went to talk to her mom. “Mom how can I take a shower without shampoo!” she cried. ” Are you serious sweet pea look at you, go get dressed and I’ll give you ten dollars so you can buy shampoo.” said her mom. “Okay mom she obediently remarked. She got dressed in her tie dyed shirt, white capris, and an orange sweater. She rapidly put on her green Vans and grabbed her sweaty ten dollars and walked to the Super Save Mart As she walked on the dirty pavement she saw boys playing soccer, girls in mini skirts walking down the street, and teenage boys smoking cigars. As Isabella Marie passed all the activity going on.”  “Sheesh, what must be going on these days?” she asked herself. Isabella Marie went inside the Super Save Mart and went to the hair products aisle. Just as she was going to get the last strawberry scented shampoo a little baby boy knocked the bottle off the shelter. “Oh, great” she exclaimed. Isabella Marie walked a little further and grumpily and grabbed the blueberry-scented shampoo. Not my favorite, but okay she thought to herself. Isabella Marie went to pay the shampoo, just when there’s a blackout. Then a guy calmly walked in the store and said,”Keep calm everyone it was an accident it will be fixed in no time.” “Uhh, when will this end!” “Sorry kid.” said the hairy clerk. ”Yeah right”,Isabella Marie replied. So she left the Super Save Mart empty-handed So Isabella Marie slowly walked back home. “Why me, why couldn’t I just buy shampoo and be happy. What’s the problem with that huh”, she screamed. Then she heard a faint voice “Shampoo for sell, shampoo of all scents”. Isabella Marie started walking faster, and then the voice was louder and louder. Finally, she approached a girl who was short, had brown wavy long hair, and tan skin.  “How can I help you……….uuuhh…”                                                                                                              “Isabella Marie!!!”, she said loud and proud.  “Okay then Isabella Marie, how can I help you?”  “You can help me by selling me some shampoo.”,Isabella Marie appealed.   “Oh about that a fat lady came and bought everything.”the girl with the brown eyes anxiously said waiting for Isabella Marie’s response.  “Oh that’s just wonderful!!!”Isabella Marie sarcastically said.  “I’m so sorry,…I I I”the girl started to lament.  “No it’s okay” Isabella Marie lied. Then Isabella Marie left without another word. Isabella Marie walked back to the Super Save Mart to check if the blackout was over and surely it was.  “Yes!!!”she yelled delighted. She  went to the hair products aisle and grabbed the strawberry shampoo and ran to the check out stand. She paid three dollars and fifty scents. Isabella Marie was so happy that she forgot the shampoo in the Super Save Mart. By the time she realized and went back to the store the shampoo was nowhere to be seen. Isabella Marie got so mad about this she went directly to the manager. There with him she complained about her problem. “Sorry kid its not my problem”, he said cooly  “Oh yes it is your problem!!!”, she snapped.  “Go watch the videos the camera recorded””, she teased. Together they saw the video of her paying the blueberry scented  shampoo.  “Oooohhhh,I told you  “Fine go and get your shampoo and leave” he grumbled  ” Thank you”, she triumphantly said. So she left with some thing that smelled like strawberries  in her hand.  THE END!!!!!!!!!!!
This is What Life After My Rape Looked Like A warning note before you start: this is long. Very long. Close to 7000 words. I've tried to break it up into sections to make it easier, but it's still a pretty long read. It shouldn't have to be said, given the title, but: TRIGGER WARNING. This piece of writing comes to you from the UK in 2005. Procedures in other countries, or in the UK at the point in time that you are reading this, may be different. Originally posted as an answer to a question on Quora. 1) The Initial Event and Aftermath I was imprisoned in my own bedroom and repeatedly raped all night. He finally left at 9am, after telling me that he'd be back later with an engagement ring, but if I reported it, he'd come back and kill me, and then go after my elderly mother. I was running on near enough 48 hours with no sleep, which is the only explanation I have for why I did the worst possible thing I could have done: I took a bath. Women do this often, due to feeling dirty and violated, and it washes away a lot of the DNA evidence. I had been a crisis worker for three years at this point, l had supported several girls through their rapes, and I knew this. I just...forgot, I guess. After he left, I was on my own in the house - Mom had left at 6 for an early shift at work, and our lodger had buggered off to wherever he went on weekdays - and I was already feeling abandoned and unloved, because I'd screamed repeatedly at the top of my lungs throughout the first half of the night, until he strangled me to keep me quiet, and neither my mom nor my lodger had rescued me. Up until maybe 4am, I'd fully expected to be rescued. It didn't seem possible that someone could hold me prisoner and rape me and strangle me in a 3-bedroom semi that I shared with two other people and a dog, all of whom were home all night. I couldn't figure out why nobody heard my loud, piercing screams, and nobody heard his roars when I bit him, and nobody heard me crying until my throat was raw, and I found myself wondering - did they hear, and just didn't care enough to investigate? So I sat in the bathtub, absent-mindedly rinsing the sweat and semen and saliva off my body, unable to think of anything other than how my life was suddenly irrevocably changed, because now I had a fiancֳ©, a fiancֳ© who would repeatedly rape me and probably beat me and almost certainly murder me after I'd reached the end of my usefulness, and that there wasn't a damn thing I could do about it because I wasn't willing to report it and risk my mom's safety. I'm assuming that the combination of shock and lack of sleep caused me to be unable to think straight. I got out of the bath and called a friend who was a policeman to ask for advice, but he didn't answer his phone. I didn't want to leave a message, so I got into bed and fell asleep almost immediately. When my mom came home after lunch, I got up and went downstairs to talk to her. I couldn't seem to force myself to use the word rape, but I managed to tell her that the guy who hadn't shown up for our afternoon coffee date yesterday had shown up in the middle of the night instead, and he had done very bad things to me against my will. My mom called the police. 2) Talking to the Police When the police arrived, I was sitting on the floor in the hall, wearing old black pants with paint on them and a brown fisherman's sweater that belonged to my late brother. For some reason, I always remember the clothes I was wearing for any given event in my past. I remember thinking I should put on proper clothes and brush my teeth, but I was just so tired, telling Mom had used up the small bit of energy I had. Mom tried to talk to me, but I wasn't making a lot of sense - I sounded, and felt, drunk. The initial officer who responded to the call was named Lee. I never caught his last name, but when he asked me if I would talk to him, I said I would, because people named Lee are always nice people. I realise now that he was a rookie, fresh out of the academy, and he probably felt totally out of his depth, but he never showed it. He was patient and kind when I told him I didn't know if I wanted to report it, because I believed if I did then my rapist would kill me and my mother. He explained to me that rape was a criminal offence, and that if he took an official report now then I wouldn't be able to withdraw it later, so I should take some time to be sure about what I wanted to do. I wasn't sure, but I knew I couldn't live with it if he raped another girl because I hadn't reported it. And there would be another girl. There would be many other girls, until someone stopped him. I knew his type well. Lee said that almost all rapists say that they'll kill the victim if s/he talks - it's how they control them - but very few attempt it. So I made the report. I don't remember much at all about this part. I know that another couple of officers showed up - Scott and Amy, as well as a bunch of crime scene techs - and that we all sat around in my living room talking while my mom made tea and coffee and finger sandwiches, as though we were having an afternoon tea party. I took a bite of a cheese sandwich, having had nothing to eat in nearly 24 hours at this point, and all three officers immediately stopped me in case there was DNA still in my mouth, so I had to spit the sandwich out and let them bag up the half-chewed bite. After several hours - I don't remember the passage of time, but I know that it was dark outside - I was told that I needed to go to hospital for a physical exam. I was allowed to go up to my bedroom, where crime scene techs had been fingerprinting everything, and get my medication and the book I was reading. While I was there, they asked me if I could point out what I'd been wearing in the night, as well as anything that he'd touched a lot and paid particular interest to. These things they bagged up and took away with them. - 1 cell phone (Nokia 3210) - 1 hand-embroidered Egyptian cotton duvet cover (still pissed about losing that one!) - 1 fitted double sheet - 2 pillowcases - 1 cheap IKEA duvet cover - 2 bath towels - 1 green fitted T-shirt - 1 pair blue pajama shorts - 1 bottle Durex Play lube Lee left, and Scott and Amy drove me to a private BUPA hospital in the next town over. My mom asked to come with us, but I told her I preferred her to stay home - I knew that I didn't have the wherewithal to take care of her as well as myself. I was shown to a small room with a private bathroom while we waited for the doctor. 3) The Medical Exam When the doctor arrived, it was clear that she was annoyed about having to be there. She was kind to me, but she'd been pulled away from a dinner party, and it was obvious that she would have preferred to be at that party. The initial parts of the examination were fine. She and a crime scene tech combed through my pubic hair and collected any stray hairs in a bag. She noted any bruising and abrasions on the outside of my vagina, and used a speculum to open me up so she could make notes on any damage to the inside of my vagina and my cervix. A few times she used a long swab and tweezers to collect hairs from inside, as well as DNA from semen. She then did the same with my anus, noting any cuts, enlarged blood vessels, and bruising, and swabbing for hairs and semen. She swabbed the back of my throat and around my teeth. After the internal exam I was finally allowed to urinate, but I had to put the toilet paper I used in a bag to be analysed for DNA. I think that was the worst part for me. Sex is not something that embarrasses me, but toilet functions are one of the few things that I am deeply private about, and handing over my urine-soaked toilet paper was probably the most humiliating, degrading moment of the whole event. While she was doing the exam, I read my book. Wolf-Speaker, by Tamora Pierce. I read because I needed the escape, but I regret that now, as I think it made me appear cool and unruffled, which is not a good thing when you're trying to convince the police that you've been raped. It didn't occur to me at this point that I might not be believed. After I peed, the tech asked if she could take a DNA sample and a set of fingerprints from me, so they could be eliminated from any results. I agreed, and she swabbed the inside of my cheek and had me roll my fingers one by one on a wet sponge pad and then onto a piece of card. I was surprised to find that the chemical they used was colourless, but she told me that they'd stopped using black ink a while back. She then told me about the national fingerprint database and national DNA database, and asked if I would be willing for my prints and DNA to go on file in the database, though she emphasised that this was not mandatory. I've never been a private person, and always thought it would be cool to be able to look myself up in a database, so I agreed. It was when the doctor had to search me for any other injuries that the problems started. The cuts on my face and lips were noted and photographed, but when she saw the bite marks and finger bruises on my throat - he'd strangled me from behind - she said that they were too old to be from the previous night, and that someone else must have strangled me a few days ago. I told her no, bruises always heal really fast on me, but she was adamant that bruises less than 24 hours old could not possibly be turning greeny-yellow at the edges already, and she refused to document them. The same went for the finger-shaped bruises on the backs and insides of my thighs. She asked if I'd been with anyone else recently - and I had. Two nights before the rape, I'd had a date that ended up in the bedroom. She said that the throat and thigh bruises must have been from him, and though I told her that my date had not been even slightly rough with me, she didn't believe me. I don't know if I blame her for this or not. The pigments that cause the green and yellow tints that bruises sometimes get, biliverdin and bilirubin, are produced when haemoglobin in blood is broken down, and they usually come after a few days of bluey-purple bruising. Logically, she should have been right about the age of the bruises. Still, I was hurt and angered by her refusal to listen to me and believe me. I felt like she was supposed to be on my side, and she wasn't. 4) Making a Formal Report Amy came over the next day, and for several days after, to take a formal report. I like to be in control of myself and of situations wherever possible, and I greeted her in makeup and clean hair and pretty clothes, which I think shocked her a bit. I remember that I wore clothes that made me feel clean and bright and wholesome: a lemon-yellow V-neck sweater, a knee-length white A-line skirt with lemon and orange and turquoise flowers on it, and a pair of white crochet ballerina pumps. The clothes were my way of taking back my body from my rapist, of showing that he would not control me, but in hindsight I realise that this added to the impression that nothing awful had occurred. I offered tea and cake and juice; as with the clothing, hostessing allowed me to impose order and ritual on a chaotic situation. These were all politely refused, and we got down to the hard work of preparing a statement. There's very little I can say about this part. It took about ten hours, spread over several days, and it covered everything from my initial meeting with the man who would become my rapist, right up until the moment he left that morning, in minute detail. I had only known him for about six weeks, and had met him twice - the day we met and the night he raped me - so I shudder to think how long it would take to create a statement for someone who was raped by a person they'd known for years. At this time, I also provided Amy with as much information as possible in the hopes that the police would be able to track him down. I didn't know his full name - I only knew him as Obie - and had no idea where he lived, but I was able to provide her with the receipts from the bar he took me to the day we met, and a fairly accurate guess at the time that he dropped me off at the Underground station afterwards, so the police were able to obtain an image of him from the CCTV cameras there. I have never been so relieved that I'm organised and tidy by nature. I was raped on a Monday night. Monday 10th October, 2005. The police were notified Tuesday afternoon. On Friday, Amy told me that the police would probably be able to track him down by the following Monday. Sure enough, on Monday Amy called to tell me that he had been found, taken in to his local police station for a "chat" where they informed him of the charges against him, and then released on his own recognisance. That scared me. I had assumed they would arrest him, and I asked Amy why they'd let him go so easily, and what would stop him coming after me and killing me now that he knew I had reported him. Amy tried to soothe my fears, telling me that when someone has been cautioned to stay away from someone, they almost always do for fear of getting in worse trouble. This one won't, I told her. This one believes he's untouchable, and he'll come after me. It's unlikely, she said. We'll see, I said. That was around 5pm on Monday. 5) Monday Night I had evening classes on Mondays. Every Monday from 7 until 9pm, I studied anatomy & physiology at Oaklands College in Welwyn Garden City. It was only nine miles from my home, but the route mostly involved narrow country lanes, and the buses were lousy in the evenings, and Mom was driving my car at that time as hers had packed up, so she was happy enough to drive the 50-minute round trip to drop me off, and again to pick me up, every Monday night. Twenty minutes before the end of class, my phone rang. You need to leave class and come outside, right now, my mother told me. Graham[the lodger] just called my cell to tell me that there's a big, angry man at the house, demanding to see you and refusing to leave. I left class. We drove to the county police headquarters, which - by happy coincidence - was right near my college, and told them what was going on. They got in touch with the St Albans branch of Hertfordshire Constabulary, and the St Albans station sent some officers to my house to investigate. We were told that we wouldn't be able to go home until he was apprehended, so we got ready to settle in for a long wait. We waited in an office belonging to - I guess the police chief? Captain? I don't really know the British police ranking system - and he was very kind, and kept bringing me soup and tea and snacks. I asked him what the full name of my rapist was, because I didn't know it, and I knew that the police must know since they'd been able to track him down, but I was told that they couldn't release that information. So next time he went out for soup for me, I asked him if he could also hunt down a blanket, and while he was gone I looked in my own file and found my rapist's name. I still feel a little bit guilty about that, to this day. He left me alone in his office because he trusted me, and I broke that trust. But I don't fully regret it. I needed to know. At 1am, we received a phone call from St Albans. They had approached him outside my house, and he had fled. It had taken several hours to catch him, but he'd been apprehended and arrested. We went home, exhausted but vigilant. 6) The Next Few Weeks Surviving the next few weeks was mostly mind over matter. I just kept putting one foot in front of the other, getting through the things that needed to be done. I felt like I was sleepwalking through it all, which I would later find out was due to the brain injury that I got from being repeatedly strangled. I saw my regular GP several times, as I was in a lot of pain. My rapist was a big man - 6'5", maybe 280 lbs - and having him on top of me for ten hours and having my body forced into unnatural positions had caused a spinal injury, where two of my lumbar vertebrae had come out of position, bruising my spinal cord. My sciatic nerve had been pinched where it exits the spine, causing pain and weakness in my legs. My larynx had been crushed, not badly enough to affect my breathing, but badly enough to make it hard to talk and to change my voice. I had a nasty case of vaginal thrush that didn't want to go away. The worst were the internal infections that I developed. My rapist had repeatedly raped me orally, vaginally and anally, without a condom, switching from one orifice to another perhaps a dozen and a half times. I developed infections in my vagina, and soon after in my uterus, due to contamination with fecal matter. I went to the sexual health clinic and got a full screening: herpes, HPV, trichomoniasis, chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhoea, HIV, all the heps. When it was time to get the blood tests done, none of the workers at the clinic could get blood from my veins, so I had to go to the main hospital and then carry my vials of blood back to the clinic in a locked metal box with a biohazard symbol on the top. This, at least, activated my (somewhat dark) sense of humour, and it was sort of fun to see people's reactions to my box. I wish I had a box like that just to carry as a purse. The box was a bright spot in a fairly nervewracking few weeks. My rapist was from a country with high rates of HIV, and the fact that he'd both raped me anally and caused me to bleed increased the chances that, if he did have HIV, he'd passed it to me. I was glad when my initial STI tests all came back negative within a week or so, but I didn't really breathe easily until my 6-month HIV window had passed. My mother held it together long enough to tell my brother what had happened, to write letters to my two best friends about it, and to take a few weeks' compassionate leave from work. At first, she couldn't get the leave as she refused to tell her boss what had happened, and it was only at my urging that she did so. Her feeling was that we needed to keep my rape a secret, while mine was to talk about it openly. After she'd talked to her boss, my brother and my two best friends, she did what she always does when she can't cope with a crisis: retired to bed, sleeping all day and spending the nights reading, eating, chain-smoking and biting her fingernails. I sound unsympathetic, and I guess I am. I shouldn't be. I can't even imagine how much it would hurt if this happened to my son. But I didn't have the energy or the emotional strength to take care of my mother. I needed it all to take care of myself. I didn't tell my father I had been raped. My father is affected by what I sometimes refer to as "engineer brain" (or occasionally "Capricorn brain") - he is a very logical, methodical person who operates best when he can analyse and evaluate situations in order to see how you can do better in future. This is great for performing science experiments, but bad for dealing with human trauma, and I didn't feel strong enough to cope with questions about why I did X and didn't do Y. I knew I'd have to say something before the court case, so I told him I had been "attacked", and that I'd reported it. He congratulated me for doing the socially responsible thing, asked if I needed help with medical bills, and advised me to put it out of my mind until I had to appear in court. My brother, the world's biggest pacifist, stomped around for a few weeks swearing revenge and talking about trying to find a hitman. I'm still not sure whether he was serious. The guy I'd dated once, the one I'd slept with two nights before the rape, fell to pieces when I told him. He cried nonstop for an hour and required copious amounts of comfort. I broke up with him. I couldn't handle babysitting his emotions any more than I could handle looking after my mom's. My best high school friend, Elle, handled it pretty well. She drove down from Bristol to stay with me for a few days - despite being back in my town bringing up her own traumatic memories - and took me out for dinner and margaritas, and said she'd come to court with me if I wanted. C, my best college friend and sort of partner, took it really hard. We'd already been through some pretty hard things that year, and his guilt over that added to his guilt over this - because he has always been the traditionalist who felt like it was his job to protect his woman - were nails in the coffin for our relationship. Years later, I found out that he blamed himself for the rape for a more substantial reason: the day I met my rapist I had had plans to meet C and his sister at the Notting Hill Carnival, and he stood me up. If he hadn't blown off our plans, I probably would never have been targeted. I didn't know what to say to this, because it was true. I never blamed him. There was no way for either of us to look into the future and see what would happen, and I told him that. But he blamed himself, and I didn't know how to comfort him. Still, like Elle, he told me he'd be there with me in court, for support. Despite my friends, I felt very alone at this time. 7) November and December November and December were one hammer blow after another. In early November, I found that I was having problems thinking properly. Schoolwork didn't come as easily to me as it had previously. I frequently found myself misusing words, or forgetting what I was doing. I walked around in a "brain fog" - similar to, but much stronger than, the fog that comes with my fibromyalgia relapses. In mid-November, the crying guy started stalking me. He'd phone me up, begging me to take him back and love him. When I refused, he'd cry and ask how I could be so cruel. Crying turned into suicide threats, suicide threats turned into angry abuse about what a horrible person I was, angry abuse circled back around to telling me how much he loved me. I ignored most of it, but occasionally he'd hit the right button to get me to respond. I probably should have changed my number, but I'd just bought a new phone after the rape - Crown Prosecution had kept my old one - and I couldn't afford to change yet again. (Changing SIM cards was not so easy in those days.) In late November - Thanksgiving night, actually - I slept with C for the first time. It was wonderful for me, but he was uneasy with me afterwards. I'd always been a tough cookie - he had loved me for many reasons, but most of all for my steadiness and solidity and strength - and the rape had caused his view of me, and consequently of his life, to shift. No matter how much I tried to reassure him that I was not as fragile as he thought, he couldn't shake this new view of me as a broken flower instead of my former granite. Being with me was too difficult for him, and he worried constantly about hurting me. It wasn't long before he got a new girlfriend, though he remained one of my closest friends for years to come, and I remained in love with him. In early December, I got a call from Scott, the second detective on my case, informing me that CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) had decided not to prosecute. They didn't believe they could secure a conviction, for a couple of reasons - the bruises on my neck and thighs that the doctor had attributed to another lover of mine, and the fact that I had changed the sheets on my bed the night I was raped. I told them I changed my bedsheets every five days, so there was a one in five chance that I'd have changed them that night, but apparently this was suspicious and led people to believe the sex was consensual. In mid-December, I had a spinal X-Ray and a couple scans on my brain, both of which showed problems. My spine would probably heal with time and physiotherapy, but the lack of oxygen to my brain had caused moderate brain damage. A few days after Christmas, I started haemorrhaging, and was eventually told I'd had a miscarriage. I hadn't even known I was pregnant - I was on the pill, and was militant about taking it correctly. The guy I'd slept with before the rape had had a vasectomy, so it was unlikely to be his, but I had no idea whether I had become pregnant by my rapist or by C, the love of my life (at that point). I was a jumbled ball of feelings - grief, disgust, anger, horror, guilt, shame. I'd always thought C and I would marry and have babies. I wasn't ready to have one at 21, but even though I hadn't known I was pregnant until I miscarried, I realised I'd wanted that baby. It almost didn't matter whether it was C's or not. It was mine. And yet I was horrified at the circumstances, and angry that I had been put in that position. And guilty and ashamed - oh yes, that too, because even though I was a medical student who was currently studying anatomy & physiology and who knew the stats about the percentage of pregnancies that end in miscarriages, I was also a girl who'd had three scans and X-Rays in the last month, and who'd blithely told the radiologists no, I couldn't be pregnant. That moment was my Despair Event Horizon. 8) 2006-2007 On New Years Day, 2006, my mom and I went out to the supermarket to buy groceries. When we got home, we pulled into the driveway, and I got out of the car. Mom turned around to close her door, and when she turned back, I was on the ground. To this day, I don't know what happened. Did I slip on the ice and fall? Did I trip over? Did I have a twisted ankle, or weak muscles, as I often do in extreme hot or cold weather? Did I have a seizure? Did something happen in my damaged brain that caused a blackout? Did I think, fuck it, I'm done with this life, I'm not playing anymore? I have no idea. What I do know is that my mother found me on the ground, with a bump on my head, and when I came around I started screaming and sobbing, because I had no idea what had happened, or where - or who - I was. For the first few hours, she didn't believe me. She thought I was playing a game for attention, and told me so. She got me to call C, who also thought I was playing a game, but he was willing to play along with it. He teased me and tried to convince me that I'd agreed to give him my diaries to read: something that would have made me laugh and roll my eyes at any normal time, but on this occasion made me fly off the handle and scream at him to never try to manipulate me. He knew, then, that something was wrong, and his best friend of five years was not the person he was talking to. That evening I received another angry, bitter text message from Crazy Stalker Guy, talking about how I was the devil's daughter and how I would be responsible for his death. These were the first impressions I got of myself. I didn't know who I was, didn't know anything about my personality - but I knew that someone felt I was the devil's daughter, and that I was selfish enough and rotten enough that the two people in the world who claimed to know me best both thought I might fake amnesia for attention. Those first impressions have never fully left me. The next day, my mother was still unsure whether to believe me or not. She told me about the rape, I think as sort of a test. The shock caused me to flee the room, and she found me after a while, curled up in the closet upstairs, a ball of fright and tears. She took me to the Emergency Department at that point, and we sat around for many hours. Eventually they sent us home and told us to contact our GP. I saw the GP, who referred me to a neurologist, and saw the neurologist for six months, who eventually said that there wasn't anything that could be done: the memory loss could have been psychological, or it could have been the bump on the head, or it could have been the brain damage, or a combination of any or all of those things. My memory might return in time, or it might not. I was offered a consultation with a psychiatrist, which I accepted, but they warned me there was a waiting list. I thought they meant days, maybe weeks. My appointment came through more than a year later. Fucking NHS. A year after my amnesia, I started getting memories back. Two years after, I had perhaps 80% of them back. I found my own psychiatrist, who helped a lot. Somewhere during that year, I forget when, I got diagnosed with PTSD. A decade later I still sometimes query that diagnosis. Some days I feel like it doesn't fit me at all, and other days I appear to be a textbook case. 9) 2008 Until Now Life moved on. Sometimes, I did too. I saw the psychiatrist that the NHS offered me on one occasion. She was a nice lady, and maybe for some people she was a good psychiatrist, but she didn't understand me at all. She kept insisting that I must have felt debased, degraded, violated, dirty. That I must have blamed myself (and, of course, that I would be wrong to do so). Nope, never, I told her. His behaviour was on him. Aren't you frightened of men now? Of sex? Nah, I told her. Most men are great, and I like sex. Sex is grand. Do you think you'll ever forgive your rapist? No. There's nothing to forgive. He is devoid of humanity and absolutely incapable of empathy or compassion. You don't hate a shark for being a shark, nor do you forgive it for biting you. It's life. But you must be angry at him? Not especially. At the end of the session, she advised me that I wouldn't be able to move on with my life until I dealt with my fear and anger and my feelings of impotence and degradation, and stopped trying to control everything. I shrugged, and didn't go back to her. I sometimes see a therapist who I used to work with, when I feel like I need to. I hate saying it, because it arouses a lot of anger in people, but for me, getting raped was, by itself, not that big of a deal. Oh, while it was happening it was scary and painful and I thought I was going to die, but it was all the other stuff that came along with it that was really hard. Losing my intelligence was the worst thing. I was what was, back in the eighties and early nineties, called a "profoundly gifted child". I don't know what my IQ was, because tests didn't work for me. I lost a little of that to the fibromyalgia brain fog that I mentioned earlier, but the majority of it I lost to the brain damage. I went from almost inevitably being the smartest person in the room to being solidly average. There's nothing wrong with average, but it hurts to lose an integral part of yourself. We all have to deal with declining grey matter as we age, of course, but not usually at 21, and not overnight. I haven't fully dealt with this loss. Maybe I never will. I was raised to believe that intelligence and kindness are the only important things, and when I lost my intelligence, I doubled up on the self-sacrifice, because I felt that my ability to help people was the only worthwhile thing about me. There are times when I still feel that way. The second big thing I lost was a potential career in surgery. With the brain damage, I developed a tremor in my hands, and you can't be a surgeon without a steady hand. With the tremor, I also lost three of my hobbies: photography, embroidery and jewellery-making. I cross-stitch occasionally, though it takes much longer than it did when my hands were steady, and I take quick snaps with my iPhone camera since the phone is light enough to not make my hands shake too much, but if I'm using a decent Canon or Nikon with changeable lenses, I'm lost unless I can use a tripod. I simply can't hold the camera, and all my shots come out blurred. My coordination has gone, for the most part. I have never relearned how to walk in high heels, play guitar or piano, waterski or drive a car. Occasionally I'll manage to reacquire a minor skill, like eating with chopsticks, and then I feel all smug and self-satisfied for days. I'll never sing again. I was no great diva, but I could entertain people at karaoke or around a campfire, and I'll never be able to do that again - the damage to my throat was too severe, the scar tissue too thick. Pineapple juice gets me through Christmas church services, weddings, and funerals. My new speaking voice is low, husky. At least my Beloved finds it sexy. :) I still get sciatica flare-ups. Walking up stairs is always hard, though hiking keeps my legs in good condition. I try to hike over all kinds of terrain; I seem to handle stairs better when I'm practicing on hills and boulder fields. Some academic knowledge stayed with me - I kept English, Geography, most medicine, some science, and some languages. I lost math, music, physics, and other languages. I'm hoping that I'll be able to relearn the math and physics in the next few years. I miss the logical beauty of equations. I can still learn, but I learn like an average person now. Old Sati used to be able to pick up most languages in days, and become fluent within a month or two. New Sati has been learning Japanese for five years and feels like she knows very little. The brain damage was such that my neurologist warned me that I might never age, emotionally and mentally. To some extent, this has proven to be true. In many ways I still feel like a 21-year-old, and an immature one at that. The books and movies and TV shows that really call to my heart are ones that are intended for teenagers. I've chosen not to have children for a number of reasons, but this is one of the big ones. I don't think it's fair for a child to grow up with a mother who they will eventually age past. Still, the last year has seen more emotional growth than the previous ten, so there's hope. I'm not sure I'd be able to have kids, even if I wanted them. I'm pretty messed up inside. I have a lot of internal scars from the infections, which has manifested as scars called adhesions. Adhesions are bands of scar tissue that stick to one another. Sometimes, usually the week before my period, some of my organs stick together. The tugging sensation is unpleasant, and it makes peeing and pooping really difficult and very painful, because bits get sort of pulled out of place. If they get bad enough, I can have surgery to have the adhesions removed...except sometimes the surgery causes new adhesions to form. For now, I'm letting things stay as they are. They don't bother me too often. I date. I sometimes fall in love. I enjoy sex, a lot, the vast majority of the time. However, sometimes it's painful, and sometimes my scars tear and I bleed. Some men cope with this gracefully, some don't. That's OK. It's a good filter. From time I time, I struggle with what I call The Void. The Void is depression and anger and despondency, but it's also me. I am The Void. Because amnesia left me a blank slate and I had to rebuild myself from scratch, there are times when I feel like nothing in my personality is real; like I am not a real person but a hollow shell covered in a veneer of intelligence and charm, and I am deathly afraid that the people who know and like me will eventually realise that none of what they see has any substance to it. Still, for the most part I enjoy my life. It's an interesting world, and I am lucky enough to have a bucketload of resilience, as well as the personality of a golden retriever or a Disney Princess, that causes me to be both naturally cheerful and full of wonder. Rape's terrible. There's no denying that. Brain damage is terrible. PTSD is terrible. Life's not.
Stephanie lost 52 pounds 20 AUGUST 13, 2019 BY AJIMA JACKSON LEAVE A COMMENT Transformation of the Day: Stephanie lost 52 pounds. She learned how to fight emotional eating, stress eating, and binge eating. Cutting out junk food, using at-home workout programs and going vegan has produced excellent results of this mom. Stephanie before and after I started gaining weight after I had my oldest son. Emotional eating, stress eating, and boredom eating were the main causes of my weight gain. I went from 165 pounds to 214 pounds. In 2014, I was my heaviest at 214 pounds. For two years after that, my weight would yo-yo up and down. It took until 2016 for me to get it right. By working out at home, using portion control, and learning to eat right, I was able to lose the weight and keep it off. I have been able to lose a total of 52 pounds. What was your motivation? What kept you going when you wanted to give up? My motivation was my kids. When I wanted to give up, I thought about how important it was to keep my health up for them. How did you change your eating habits? The first thing I did was understand the reasons behind my weight gain, which were stress eating, boredom eating, and emotional eating. I cut out junk food, such as cookies, chips, and candy that I was binge eating with. I learned how to make better food choices and how to meal prep by using Beachbody programs. Lastly, I went from an unhealthy vegetarian to a vegan. Tell us about your workout routine. I worked out at home 6 to 7 days a week using Beachbody programs and became a Beachbody coach. My very first program was P90X. Stephanie before and after What is your height? 5’6″ How long did your transformation take? I started my journey in 2014 and got serious in 2016. So far, it’s been a five-year transformation, and I’m still going. What is the biggest lesson you’ve learned so far? The biggest lesson I learned was to not binge out on junk when I got bored or stressed. What advice would you share with people who want to lose weight? The best advice I could give is for other people is to understand WHY you want or need to lose weight and make that your motivation. Instagram: @MRSSEXXYSTEPP Stephanie before and after

Time to plant seeds! What should we plant in February and March? Day 1, parsley and thyme Day 22, parsley and thyme Hello everyone! Although it may not be spring officially yet, the outside tells us different! Nature is slowly waking up, so this is the best time to plant seeds. They say "What you plant you harvest" so make sure you make it right.  What herbs should I plant?  Let's see. The most common herbs people use in kitchen are parsley, basil, thyme, oregano and dill. Guess what! You can plant them now. All of them are heat loving so make some space at home and by the time it's warm enough outside, you can have little plants ready for your outside garden. You can plant them indoors as well, just like me and other people who don't have garden.  How to plant seeds:  You need: seeds, light, water, proper soil (I buy special soil mix for herbs) and some plastic containers or flowerpots (one for each kind of seeds) 1) fill the containers with soil, let 3 cm space on top 2) sprinkle the soil with water and according to instructions on the each packet plant the seeds (especially mind the depth and distance between them) 3) put 1-2 cm of soil (the bigger plant is going to grow, the more soil you put) on top and slightly sprinkle with water again. 4) let it grow on a sunny place and every 2 days sprinkle with water. Remember, seeds take some time to grow :) Tip: Have you heard about Community gardens? A community garden is a single piece of land gardened collectively by a group of people. They could be small areas where people grow small plots of vegetables, to large "greening" projects to preserve natural areas, to tiny street beautification planters on urban street corners. Some grow only flowers, others are nurtured communally and their bounty shared. It can be a great way to meet new people and make some friends with mutual hobby. It could be a solution for those who don´t have a garden of their own (most likely people in big cities). In most cases, gardeners are expected to pay annual dues to help with garden upkeep, and the organization must manage these fees. The tasks in a community garden are many, including upkeep, mulching paths, recruiting members, and fund raising. There could be a lot of fun, too. Community meetings, support, and romantic bonfires where you can "hear the veggies grow" in the night.   
Ups and Downs ? Have had an odd week since my last post. All started well on Wednesday and I ate like a pig trying to use all my points.    Weight Watchers has changed and in my opinion for the better.  Fruit is now free and most vegetables so it's all the other stuff that goes with it that you have to point. You are allocated a daily allowance of points that are calculated on you weight, sex, age and height which you have to use each and every day. Non of this carrying over business like there used to be. Then all members have an additional weekly allowance of 49. This can be used on whatever and however you want. I am at the moments splitting it between my days so I have 33 points a day. But if I am going out, or having a meal I can use them towards this instead.  So what have I eaten this week ?? Wed: 04/01 BreakFast - 2 x Turkey Rashers                  Baked Beans                  Slice of Toast  Lunch -       Brown Rice                  Wafer This Ham                   Cucumber and Celery                  no fat strawberry yoghurt Dinner -      Fillet of Salmon                  Broccoli and sweetcorn Snacks -     2 full fat Babybel                 1 curly Wurly Thurs: 05/01 Breakfast -  2 egg omlette with ham Lunch -       2 Weight Watcher (WW) Tortillas with wafer thin ham                  Cucumber, Sweetcorn                  1 red apple Dinner -      4 bacon medallions                   Mushrooms                  A poached egg                  Baked Beans                  1 slice of toast with flora light                  Brown Sauce                  Raspberry Sorbet Snack -       1 full fat Babybel Fri 06/01 Breakfast -  Baked Beans on a slice of Wholemeal toast with flora light Lunch -       Golden Rice                   Wafer Thin Ham                   Philadelphia extra light                  6 x Melba Toast  As some of you know after lunch I was taken to hospital and had the pleasure (not) of an overnight stay. The good thing is it was nothing serious and I am under treatment. The not so good thing was the fact that I had lost my appetite and only ate because I had to. Dinner  - A cheese sandwich with proper butter on white toast and slice of toast with porper butter later on. Sat - 07/01  Breakfast - 2 slices of white toast with proper butter Just before lunch I was discharged and my husband took me home then went shopping with our daughter !!!!! Not as bad as you might think, he was very thoughtful, (as I felt like crap for the next few days) and bought me in some crumpets for breakfast, which he found out are quite low pointed, and some weight watcher meals so I could just stick something in the oven when I was hungry and still keep on track. So how did I do ??   drum roll please ..................................................................................... I lost a fantastic 4lb.  I am so pleased, to say I didn't have an appetite and ate lots of white bread (my vice) that I still lost so much. I am going to set my self little goals instead of a large goal that will seem impossible to meet. My first is losing 5 % of my starting bodyweight. This means I have 5lbs to loose and I am determined to meet this in the next 3 - 4 weeks.  I'm not sure what my finishing weight will be, but I have a particular summer dress I would like to me wearing this year. Will keep you posted xx
Farewell to 2014, Hello 2015 2014 has been a hard year, with a week-long hospital stay early on and then weeks of serious illness in June, difficulties with the boys (teens and menopause are an insane mix), and continued financial difficulties. Good points have been the prospect of improving interpersonal difficulties through outside help we started accessing a couple of months ago, quilting retreats (always a good way to re-energise) and, as a result of my illnesses, discovering who our 'friends in action' are - those who stepped up and put their good wishes into actions when we needed help.  Made new friends, and discovered old ones. The boys enjoyed St John's Cadets (David, now 16, and his Division winning the State Drill Team award), Scouts (James, now 15, will be moving up to Venturers beginning this year) and archery, and Blake (now 11) enjoyed soccer, inline skating, wave-boarding, scooters, parkour and fishing.  John became active with the CFS, working on their Incident Command Vehicle, and he's done a great job (finally) in getting our small yard planted into a producing vegetable patch. http://sapa.asn.au/ 2015 is off to a rocky start, but plans are to fight against fatigue and pain and get the boys to as many Catholic events as possible (unfortunately most are down town so it will be an ongoing strain on health and finances).  The idea is to connect the boys with people their own ages who are fired up about their faith so that the boys don't see it as boring or irrelevant. David will be going away for 10 days in January for a Summer School of Evangelisation in Melbourne - his first big trip away!  Will have to offload some excess jewellery to find the money but I know it will be well worth it. http://www.summerschool.org.au/index.php I'll be off on a 3 1/2 day quilting retreat around the same time - it's a 'charity quilts' retreat at which we'll only be working on quilts that will be donating to charitable causes, e.g. heart kids, fire/flood victims, etc.  Sooooo looking forward to it.  I'm also planning to make a serious dent in my PhDs during the holidays and through the year. http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KOv7CbHYs18/UIl8RuxercI/AAAAAAAAB2w/XrdV8Oyzhxc/s400/202169470742578342_pag7INtl_c.jpg I've lots of ideas to do with the family this year - scheduled 'friends for dinner' days so the boys get to have friends over and include them in our family dinners, more structured outdoor activities like archery, cooking demonstrations & classes, parkour, fishing and beach days, etc (booked into my diary so they actually happen!). Also plan to get more involved in community activities - might even take up the ukulele!
Peanut Butter Cup Blondies There was a beautiful breeze blowing through my kitchen window on Sunday morning. Everyone in my family was taking a nape, leaving the house was quiet, with the exception of the birds chirping outside, the trees blowing in the wind, and the sound of the an occasional card driving by on this dead end road. It felt so much like autumn I think I should've been baking apple pie instead of blondies! These blondies are very moist, dense, soft but still chewy, with the wonderful taste of peanut butter and chocolate. I've used this blondie recipe before, and I stole the chocolate frosting recipe from my awesome friend "hollie". The difference? This time instead of nuts and chocolate chunks, put chopped Reeses peanut butter cups in the batter. No, it's not original at all, but it's extremely tastey! blondie1.jpg I used a 12 oz. package of reeses minature peanut butter cups and chopped them however I liked. Usually fours, thirds and in half. blondie3.jpg Blondies (recipe found here, on SmittenKitchen) one 12 oz. package of Reeses miniature peanut butter cups. 16 tablespoons butter (2 sticks) , melted 2 cup brown sugar (I used dark) 2 egg 2 teaspoon vanilla 2 Pinch salt 2 cup all-purpose flour Unwrap Peanut Butter cups and chop into pieces of either fours, thirds, or halfs. Butter an 9x13 pan Mix melted butter with brown sugar - beat until smooth. Beat in egg and then vanilla. Add salt, stir in flour. Stir in chopped Reeses. Pour and spread into pan. Bake at 350°F 20-25 minutes, or until set in the middle. (mine cooked a little longer than this) While baking, prepare frosting. Chocolate frosting: 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 6 tbls. boiling water 1 stick butter 3 cups powder sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract add the cocoa powder and water in a medium bowl and stir into a soft mass. Add butter and blend to combine, about 30 seconds. Beat in powder sugar and vanilla on low speed until incorperated. Beat on medium speed until forsting lightens and is fluffy, about 2 minutes. Let Blondies cool the spread with forsting. WARNING: these won't last long!
The Light  I died once. 5 years ago. There was no reason. It just happened. My heart stopped beating. I am only alive today because someone, one man, refused to give up on me. Like I had a purpose. I was given a second chance. But why? Why me? What amazing things could I do in this broken world? Me. Out of all the people who die everyday. Me. I was chosen. I was given another chance at life. Like great things are expected of me. But what?  They say everything happens for a reason. But that's not true. Some things just happen. No reason. It's simply God's will.  I will always wonder why I was given a second chance. I'm human! We, as humans, question everything. It's in our nature.  The light. That's a purpose. I headed straight for it. I was excited. All my pain was about to end. A great new beginning was ahead. Then, suddenly, a surge of pain hit my chest! The light became brighter. Almost blinding! A man lingered above me. He looked tired. Concerned. Scared. But, yet, oddly determined. Who was this man? He was in no way familiar! It took what seemed like hours (but were a mere few seconds) to realise what was going on. I was in an ambulance. The siren was deafening. The lights were blinding. This man suddenly looked relieved! Then I realised, he was a paramedic. He said "welcome back! Stay with me now!" He had saved my life 3 times from the moment I collapsed. He told me not to panic. That everything will be okay. I trusted him. He seemed trustworthy. There was something rather soothing about his voice. I felt safe. I did as I was told. Then everything went black.  I awoke in the hospital only a mere few minutes later. I felt tired. Exhausted even. My chest felt like I had been crushed beneath a fallen building. People were rushing all around me. I had a nurse next to me checking my blood pressure. A friend sat at my other side. He looked so scared. What had happened?  I asked the nurse. She was lovely. She had a very kind and gentle voice. She told me that I was a fighter. She said I was lucky to be alive. She told me "well done for hanging on"! I had stopped breathing. From there my heart stopped beating. The paramedic got it going again 3 times.  3 times.  3 times that man saved my life! I was so grateful, yet oddly confused. Why was I saved? Why was I given that second chance at life! A fighter? Me? I didn't see it. 19 years old. Fighting fit. And I died 3 times. MentaI! I recovered. Went on to train horses. Broke many bones - including my back. I actually got crushed by this marvelous beast and still walked away. The nurse was right. I was a fighter. After my near death experience, nothing ever got the better of me again. I realised that anything is possible! We all hold the key to our own destiny. We choose the paths in our lives. Sometimes, we get a little lost along the way. Sometimes, we need someone to help point is in the right direction.  1 man helped me choose mine. He showed me anything and anyone can be worth fighting for. He faught for me. A complete stranger. He fought to keep me alive! Now 5 years on, I can't help but think, "was it all worth it?" "Should he have spent his energy on another?"  Sometimes I find myself wishing he hadn't fought so hard to keep me alive. I feel as though his efforts are being wasted. I will forever be in his debt and utterly grateful that, because of this man, my parents didn't have to bury their daughter.  Everything happens for a reason... So why me? Do I think I will ever find the answer I am searching for? No. Some things just are. Not everything has a reason behind it. We just have to learn to accept what is and live our lives to the best of our abilities... I like to think, one day, I will do amazing things to aid this broken world. One day. Just not today...
Digestive Bugs; a Hidden Cause of Weight Gain in Women Did you know, digestive bugs are a hidden link to unexplained weight gain in women?  The great news is, there is herbal and nutritional support that WILL make a difference. Although I have previously discussed digestive flora before from it's influence on serotonin and cravings, new findings directly link it to poor glycaemic control and unexplained weight gain – and after 16 years of practice, it really makes so much sense! Recent research has shown that digestive health, plays a significant role in both obesity and diabetes, primarily due to a deficiency in a protein called toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a regulator of digestive flora in our gastro intestinal tract. This allows harmful bacteria to multiply and taking probiotics can actually make it worse! In short, a TLR5 deficiency changes your metabolism. It means you can exercise and count calories or live on lettuce leaves and not lose weight. The reason being, the food you eat is absorbed at a faster caloric rate than it is meant to. Think of the example of you are out to coffee with a friend, you both have a skiny latte – your absorbency is the equivalent to having two! This is because a deficiency in TLR5 causes: Increased carbohydrate storage Increased caloric absorption Increased insulin production Increased leptin resistance Increased fatty acid absorbency This means, if you have unhealthy digestive flora and a 'gut bug', although you eat healthy, you may extract more calories from your foods, even if they are 'healthy' and gain more weight. This is why you might eat less than your friends but still gain weight! Top three causes of toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) deficiencies Gram negative digestive bacteria Chronic infections Genetics Chronic stress Antibiotic use Symptoms Cravings and increased appetite Unexplained weight gain Stubborn fat around the middle Bloating, digestive disturbances Unexplained high cholesterol Unexplained high blood pressure Unexplained fatigue Unexplained pain and inflammation Poly Cystic Ovarian Disorder Test results may show: 1. Elevated CRP 2. Digestive dysbiosis or inflammatory bowel conditions 3. Elevated Free Fatty Acids 4. Auto immune markers 5. Poor glycaemic control 6. Poly Cystic Ovarian Disorder or Cysts 3 Easy Steps to Stopping This Cycle Today 1. Don’t wait. I can guarantee you, it won’t 'fix' itself, it will only get worse. 2. You MUST reduce bacterial levels and restore balance 3. You MUST restore glycaemic control and improve insulin sensitivity To Join or Not To Join?

Looking for Podcasts In my absence I have decided now is the time to start looking after myself more. You know, the usual way like eating better and exercising more... Of course, as fate would have it mere days after making this decision to be more active I happened to fall down the stairs resulting in an injured knee. My own fault for trying to navigate the stairs whilst half asleep and not turning on the light! Fortunately the damage is not too severe and I can still perform normal tasks, such as going to work (oh the joy!) but I am going to postpone any serious exercise for a few weeks until my knee is functioning a bit better. So what better way to pas the time than searching for things to listen to when said fitness time rolls around. I want something other than music to listen to, this is where you come in, my lovely readers... Can you please recommend some podcasts that you enjoy, bookish or non book related, I am open to any suggestions. Thanks in advance.
It's the Circle of Life! As you can see by my most recent blog post, I have discovered a new love. No, it's not for buying shoes, or going to the gym or other such things people seem to have love affairs with. It's for a much more geekier past-time. Yes. I watch documentaries. Since I discovered a website where you can watch them for free, I've been addicted. I've watched movies on the human mind and body, on religion, on racism, on heaps of incredibly interesting topics that I find fascinating. I know many people think that documentaries and mind-numbing boredom go hand in hand, but if you watch documentaries on topics that you're interested in then it's absolutely riveting.  However. With this discovery, I have learnt something about myself. I have learnt that I can NOT watch documentaries about... Animals. There. I said it.  I just find them far too emotionally traumatising. Animal documentaries lull you into a false sense of security. They show you clips of adorable sea-otters holding hands and deer frolicking in the meadow while birds sing and the sun shines. And then, they flash up a few clips of these sea-otters being swallowed whole by a seal, or the deer being slowly chased until they collapse with exhaustion and are descended upon by wolves. I know what you're thinking. "It's the circle of life, Emily. Everyone needs to eat." I try to remind myself the wise words of Mufasa. The lion eats the antelope but "When we die, our bodies become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass. And so we are all connnected in the great Circle of Life. " At this stage, I'm surprised I even manage to get through the Lion King without falling into an emotional heap. I understand that it's all natural and proper but I can't help but feel terribly sad. I watched a show about baby turtles and how they have to find the ocean once they're hatched, but birds fly by and snatch them off the ground so only a small percentage ever make it to the sea. The rest struggle helplessly in the birds claws. Or take tonights documentary for example, in which whales played a hunting game with a poor seal until it was slumped, exhausted on an ice float. A sneaky whale came up, bit it's tail and slowly dragged it into the water, with the seal looking helplessly towards the camera. Maybe it was the fact that the seal reminded me slightly of my dog, but whatever the reason, I find animal documentaries far far too sad. So from now on I shall watch informative documentaries that steer away from the animal kingdom. To avoid being ignorant, maybe I'll read wildlife articles... That way I don't have to see their puppy dog eyes as they're nommed on by a lion.

July's Foodie Penpal reveal day................ Well it's that time of the month again, so it must be time for one thing. Reveal day! This month I was selected to send my box to Kimberley @ fullasanegg Apart from a dislike of perfumey (is that a word?) tastes she didn't have any preferences so I was able to run wild with my box. You can see what she thought of it here. I received my box from the lovely Julia @ sthingmissing.    She writes a brilliant blog with recipes that all "have something missing" whether that be gluten, dairy, eggs or meat/animal products proving that you don't have to miss out on great food and treats if you are on a restrictive diet. Her pineapple and coconut semi-freddo recipe is to die for!  I always try and resist peeking at the box's content before I've read the letter, but after reading she'd made me some gingerbread men I just couldn't resist and had to have a quick peek. They looked so cute looking up at me with their wonderful chocolate shoes. She even sent me a cookie cutter and the recipe so I could have a go at making my own. There is only two left in the photo, the rest had already been devoured by my little boy and his friend. I did manage to try one of the remaining ones and it was delicious.  Stevie has helped me eat the Cadbury's chocolate mascot too. It was like eating an Easter egg in the middle of July.  We live near to the City of Coventry stadium where some of the Olympic football matches are being played, so it's nice to get into the spirit of the games (any excuse for chocolate!) I love both mustard and Guinness so I was excited to find this little beauty in my box. I quite like a cheese and mustard sandwich (I'm odd, I know) so that's how I first tried it. The Guinness flavour was very subtle but it was a nice mustard all the same. I'm going to try in my sausage and leek casserole when the weather cools down. I nearly bought plantain chips to go in the parcel I send this month but changed my mind at the last minute so I'm interested in trying them myself, but I haven't got round to sampling them yet.  The thing I'm most excited about is trying Julia's Tom Yam Kung recipe, she sent me. She told be how she had learnt this recipe from the locals at a Thai cookery school whilst travelling in Thailand. She thoughtfully included some of the ingredients for me to use. Lime leaves are not something I would usually keep in my store cupboard so it was fantastic to find them in my box.  Another first for me is white tea. I love spiced tea and enjoying drinking fruit teas in the summer but I like my black tea very, very strong so I wasn't sure if the delicate taste of white tea would be for me. I was actually quite surprised as I really quite liked it. Thanks again go to Julia for putting together my box of treasure.  If you are in the UK and would like to take part next month, fill in the application form here  before the 4th August. If you are reading this from America or Canada they you can join in here 
What is Fattening? You hear people say, "I can't have that, it's fattening" all the time. What does fattening really mean? Presumably it means that the food you are eyeing is likely to add fat to your body. But how do people define 'fattening'? Is it a certain number of calories? A certain amount of fat?  Just about any food can provide you with an excess of calories if you eat too much of it. Likewise, there may be a very calorie-dense food (like chocolate cake or pecan pie) that won't really add on the pounds if you choose to consume a small portion of it.  I'd like to challenge you to re-define your use of the word. Think about foods in terms of portion sizes. Realize that apples may be fattening if you eat 10 of them at one time (total calories: 600), and a three-musketeers bar is not fattening if you have one fun sized bar (total calories: 60).  There are virtually no foods prohibited from a weight loss diet when consumed in moderation. Find out which of the foods you regularly eat are very high in calories (butter, salad dressing, ice cream) and reduce your portions of them or find lower calorie alternatives (spray butter; low-fat or low-calorie dressings; ice milk or low-fat ice cream). Fill up on the low calorie foods that you enjoy (carrots, watermelon, rice cakes, low-fat yogurt) to satisfy your hunger. Remember that foods themselves are not fattening, but rather it is how much you eat of them that makes them higher in calories.  What can you eat a smaller portion of this week to save on calories? Let us know!
Shameless Self-Promotion Hello friends! I feel like I'm awkwardly trying to re-connect with a long lost friend who I neglected for a while... But I'm sure that you have all been very busy and haven't noticed my lack of writing at all! If you have noticed, thanks for being a reliable reader and I'm sorry to disappoint! But for the rest of you, I'm sure a simple explanation will suffice. I have been very busy of late, finishing my musical theatre course, performing in the Showcase, and much more! But most importantly, I wanted to talk to you about my musical. I've mentioned it a few times in this blog, but recently my writing partner and I have decided to take it to a new level and put on a big showing of the show. We have a venue almost booked, we have a rehearsal room booked, auditions scheduled, rewrites being planned and technically minded friends being put into a list to be contacted later. I'm mentioning it to you because I know there may be some of you who perform and love to be a part of amateur shows. Here's your chance to be a part of something special, because the opportunity to be involved in a brand new, original piece of Australian theatre comes along very rarely. As the show is still growing, this is your chance to make a mark on the show - help it reach that next level. Heck, help it become successful! We need you enthusiastic, creative, generous people to give this show life in any way you can, so if you are even slightly interested, check out the event page and maybe even book an audition. And if you have no performing talents/interest whatsoever, maybe you could come see the show and support the young writers of today. Click here to check it out!
Some sugar, but mostly sense. I baked last night and this morning. There's a ridiculous amount of things I still need to post, and I don't know where to start! I haven't uploaded last night's pictures. Suffice to say: dark chocolate. And green tea. Mmm. On another note. Borders just released their 100 Favourite Books of All Time I had a really quick look at the top ten. 1. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen 2. To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee 3. Lord of the Rings, J. R. R. Tolkien 4. My Sister's Keeper, Jodi Picoult 5. Twilight Saga Collection, Stephanie Meyer 6. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone 7. The Time Traveller's Wife, Audrey Niffenegger 8. The Book Thief, Mark Zusak 9. Nineteen Eighty Four, George Orwell 10. Magician, Raymond E. Feist I'm not too happy with this list, to be completely honest. I get that the top three are classics, and I really liked 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. We studied it in English class, and I really enjoyed it. Harry Potter and The Book Thief are both excellent as well. But Twilight? It's 'favourite books of all time', not 'favourite ridiculous tween fantasy vampire fads'. I'm sorry if I annoy anyone with this rant, but TWILIGHT. COME ON PEOPLE. It's a pathetic love story, with a Mary Jane protagonist that is selfish, whiny and just plain annoying. FIFTH? Even undead blood-drinkers and lycans can't redeem the book. You want vampires? Go to Anne Rice, or Bram Stoker. Not Stephanie Meyer. Okay. I'm over it. -breathes- I'm just disappointed Neil Gaiman (American Gods was 71), Alice in Wonderland (came 32nd), Gregory Maguire, Terry Pratchet (Good Omens was 96th) or any other really good authors didn't make it up there. Stupid Twilight.
Eating Right When Dining Out  Everybody loves eating out and there's not reason why you shouldn't - except the fact that most restaurant-foods are high in fat, salt, sugar or calories in general! New health care legislation in the States will require (some time during this 2011) that big restaurant chains indicate how many calories each of their food items contains; however, it's not always possible to get the information you want.    - Some fats are good for you while other are not - Monounsaturated fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, olives and olive oils, can help lower your LDL and maintain your HDL and polyunsaturated fats in vegetable oils, fish, mixed nuts, edamame and seeds could help decrease your cholesterol in general. So ordering grilled seafood when you go out will offer you taste, heart healthy benefits and omega 3 fatty acids. Meanwhile, the fats you should be aware of are trans fats, saturated fats and cholesterol. These are found in greasy cheeses, palm oil, coconut oil, shortenings, butter, creamy sauces, stuffed with cheese, meats and whole dairy products. Fried foods  are the main concern here. Foods that are labeled as "golden crispy" to induce your mouthwatering appetite are fried with trans/saturated shortenings, ghee (clarified butter) or lard (pork fat) that will in return make your blood cholesterol spike!  - To make foods more palatable, salt (sodium) is the key. Restaurant foods can be very high in sodium. Now whether or not you are medically required to decrease your sodium intake because of high blood pressure for instance, research has shown that a low sodium diet can benefit any healthy youngster. However, the point here is to know how to spot high sodium foods. Foods that are pickled, creole sauce, smoked, marinated, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, cocktail sauce, bacon, MSG (monosodium glutamate) added to meats or Chinese foods to give them their umami taste and canned foods are all high in salt. Therefore, don't add any table salt, ask your food to be done without extra salts and learn how to spot salty ones.  - Most restaurants label foods with extra symbols on the side: All you have to do is look for "Heart-healthy" or "Light" symbols: these are usually a red heart, a green butterfly, etc. These offer low fat, low salt and low cholesterol items making it easier for you to know which foods are the best to choose from. Watch out not to mistaken them with flags symbolizing most popular food choices.  - Don't be afraid to ask how the food is prepared and what ingredients are used. Tell your server that you are staying away from high caloric foods, high fatty/salty ones and ask for special requests for a lighter version of that meal. You can ask the chef to prepare foods using less oil, no butter, less sugar, less syrups, less salt, you name it! It's actually easy to be done so go for it next time you're eating out. You can also ask for healthier substitutions such as: baked potatoes instead of a side french fries order low fat milk instead of whole milk in your coffee fresh salad instead of glazed or sautteed vegetables And if there are no substitutions, eat smart: peel off the chicken skin ask your server to skip putting fries in your plate skip the butter, cream, cheese, fried/sautteed vegetables, fatty fressings and dips know your meats: skip high fat meats, rib-eye, pork, bacon, lamb, T-bone steaks and go for leaner ones - Ask for your sauces, dressings, gravy or dips on the side! This way you can skip them or dip less than you would have if it were already all mixed together. In addition, know which dressings to order with your salad and which not to. Ask for balsamic dressing, lemon-oil, light mayo, lemon, vinaigrette, citronette, mustard,tabasco, marinara with your pasta (tomatoes, garlic, onions), primavera without cream or small amounts (2 tbsps) of guacamole or low fat sour cream. Skip dips and dressings: heavy creamy ones such as heavy lemon, heavy vinegar, thousand island, Caesar's, cocktail, tartar, bechamel, tempura, mayonnaise and  homestyle dressings. - Know menu linguistics for healthy and unhealthy foods: Restaurants often describe foods using specific words that aim to lure your appetite while explaining how the food has been prepared.  Watch out for: fried, batter-fried, au gratin, in cheese sauce, marinated in oil, double crust, sauteed, braised, crispy, glazed, golden, deep fried, prime, rich, buttered, buttery, breaded, creamy, beurre blanc, bearnaise, with mayonnaise sauce, creamed, escalloped, cheesy, Hollandaise, pan fried, rich in butter sauce or pan roasted.  Whereas go for foods that are: baked, braised, cooked in its own juices, dry boiled (in wine or lemon juice), lightly sauteed, stir-fried, broiled, barbecued, roasted, boiled, grilled, poached and steamed. Extra Dining out Tips: Always start with a green salad on the side, it will help make you fuller for longer. Keep in mind that peas, corn, croutons, olives, avocados, couscous, cheeses and meats could be part of a salad but are not considered as greens (which have the least calories in your meal, thus will help you make full without extra calories). Downsize portions: always think small. A double cheeseburger is around 600 calories while a cheeseburger is 340. Also, super fries could contain 540 calories whereas a small one accounts for 210 calories. Ask for whole wheat/brown/mutli-cereal breads, pasta and doughs.  Order a thin crust pizza, no cheesy stuffings, with extra sauce, half the cheese topping, vegetables as toppings and skip the meats. Moreover, it's best if you stick to 2-3 slices max. Occasionally have a small portion of lighter alternatives for desserts: a scoop of diet ice cream, 1/2 cup of fruits smoothies, a cup of fruit salad, leeches and avoid high fatty, creamy and sugary ones.  Try to decrease fluids intake with your meal. However, if you choose to have a drink go for water, unsweetened tea or sugar and alcohol-free drinks. Go for a small or medium portion of a meal or share a big one with a friend. Most meals nowadays are huge so don't over-indulge.
Starting Stage 2 I have to admit that I put this off as long as I felt I possibly could without looking like a total procrastinator. I don't really understand why I felt so intimidated by moving onto Stage 2. Maybe it was because I really wanted to start working out in a gym setting and I couldn't get the gym membership like I wanted to this past week. So...I made the committment to Jen that I would do the workout tonight after I put That Other Kid to bed. She even asked me what time he went to bed! Gosh I couldn't even wessel out of it like that! So I pulled my book out (that I still haven't made the time to read all of, sorry Karena!) and pulled up the tutorials that Karena put up -- THANKS Karena! I got everything situated and ready to go and got started. And honestly, it wasn't nearly as bad as my head had it set up to be. I guess I made it out to be a lot worse than it really was. Funny thing about it is that about 5 minutes after I got started That Other Kid came out into the living room and said, "gosh that looks hard...you are sweating already!" and I was. It obviously was hard, but in a good way. :) I kept my weights pretty consistent and since I am doing the workout at home I had to find a way to make the horizontal wood chop work. Actually it wasn't too difficult since we have resistance bands. I found a columm and wrapped the band around it and pulled away! I'm going to need to find a way to add some weights too it since that seemed pretty easy. The one workout that I am not sure I will be able to continue with is the Static Lunge, rear foot elevated. I started it with the weights and did 1 and had to drop the weights. I did the 2 sets of 10 with only my body weight and it really hurt. I will try it again next time I do workout A but if it is still hurting I'm going to drop it. I don't need the pain.... I was surprised at how uncoordinated I felt during the dumbbell one-point row. I wasn't sure I was doing it right so I moved to the bedroom so I could watch myself in the mirror. My right leg wobbled and shook the whole time I was doing the set. My left leg felt a bit better but I still had to pause a couple of times. As for the plank and pushups, I am surprised at how fast my upper body has weakened since I ended the March core workouts. I was able to do the 2 sets of planks for 60 seconds but my arms were shaking! I did manage to do 2 sets of on the toe pushups but I didn't go down far enough....That will be my goal during this stage; to make my 20 pushups be "full on the toe" AND "nose to the ground". As for the progress I made during stage 1...I successfully completed it which is better than I honestly thought I would do but I didn't lose weight (gained it instead, grrrrrr) and I only lost a few inches, so I won't be doing pictures yet. I still need to work on the diet and now that I am on medication I will hopefully start losing weight! I am biking (or at least trying to) every day so that will be my cardio for now. I love biking and it helps me get outside 30 minutes a day like the dr told me to do! Thanks for letting me be a part of the #Ironsisters!! I love the support I am getting and I love that I am lifting weights!
Time for change Hey everyone, I have some news. It's actually huge news and I'm nervous as hell.  Until recently I've been back and fourth in my mind with this decision. And I feel like I need to vent. So two days ago I reached out to a gender therapist and scheduled an appointment.  I'm terrified! I'm terrified that they will confirm my suspicions that I'm transgendered. I'm also terrified equally that they will tell me I'm not trans. Does that make any sense.  I have been suppressing these feeling for so long I feel like it's almost normal to feel numb. But talking to some people in my life from this community and my friend here at home has given me a new sense of reality. I've  been fantasizing in my mind at the idea of just being myself. Just allowing myself to be me, whoever that may be..  I have concerns about my daughter. I have a little girl who is seven. She and I are super close. And I'm scared for what this will mean for her and I and our future. It also concerns me that I'm 34 and not a small petite man. The testosterone has been doing its thing for far too long.   I actually thought of self medicating years ago just to get that feeling of being someone else. The feeling of medamorphasis that lots of the girls describe. But it's so dangerous to self medicate and there is far too much to lose and leave behind. Besides, if I'm gonna start on hormones, I think it will be obvious to most people that I would be changing and the question goes to, why not just come out and do it right. But I'm not sure I am trans.. Although I'm pretty sure I am.  I'm not suicidal, nor do I feel depressed. I just feel empty. Like my time as who I am now has run it course and there no more I could do. Other times I feel like I'm living a lie and I am trying too hard to be who I'm not. Other times I feel like I'm exactly who I'm supposed to be. But it always fades.   So I want to start using this blog while I'm going through my self exploration to discuss gender issues. I want to get your insight on different topics. I know many of my friends in this wonderful community who have transitioned and they are brave and strong for doing it. They have endless advice to give and I'm willing to take it all to the bank.  My friend Danielle asked me the other day to name three things I love and cherish in my life. Naturally, I said my daughter, my new found health and my family/friends.  She paused as she teared up with a half cocked grin. Her words were never more pure and true.  She said, "You never mentioned yourself. You never put yourself, your actual self on the list. It's okay to self love as long as you truly see yourself and feel good."   She was right, not that I mind putting everyone in my life first but it's okay to put ourselves at the top of the list.  So in the most purest of ways, I feel like I'm doing that by making this appointment.  So I want to thank Dee and Dawn for everything. They have been great friends. I've never felt such a connection to people I've never met before in person. But if you could use people like them to describe our community and how we take care of each other, it would paint a perfect picture.  And I will still make captions but I really want to start using this blog for more. I want to discuss these topics and so much more.  Thank you everyone, and as always I hope you're all healthy and happy.  Feel free to comment your thoughts. And I'll join in the discussion.  xoxoxo Katie Mills
1 Day Detox- Hollywood/Red carpet diet! Hi there :) I have been following a one day detox each week and using the Hollywood diet regime without buying the cleansing drink. I make my own to save ££s. About the Hollywood diet The Hollywood Diet originated -surprise -In Hollywood! It claims to be a 48 hour miracle diet, where you are allowed to drink only a specially formulated juice. This juice will be the only thing that you are permitted to consume for the next two days. It contains 100 percent of the necessary vitamins and minerals you need in a regular diet. In theory, you should lose between 5 and 10lbs in the 2 days whilst on the diet, this will vary depending on your metabolism and starting weight. While on the diet you must refrain from drinking alcohol, caffeine based drinks and smoking. The original Hollywood 48 Hour Miracle Diet Juice is a recipe for a 2-day liquid fasting diet, which is a homemade version of "The Hollywood Diet". If you follow it correctly, you can lose up to 10 pounds in 2 days. You will be drinking only liquids for two days. It is recommended that you do not repeat this diet more than once or twice per month. My Version I detox for one day (not 2 like the Hollywood diet) and drink the juice for breakfast and Lunch and make a large soup for the evening. Here is the Hollywood diet drink recipe: Ingredients Juice of 4 oranges Juice of 2 lemons 2 Tbls. Manuka honey 1 banana, peeled and sliced 1 apple peeled and sliced 1 cup of grape juice (can be store bought) Combine the ingredients and blend or stir thoroughly. This will make enough concentrate to last you one day. Add 1 litre or 2 pints of distilled or spring water, and sip the juice throughout the day. If you get thirsty, you may drink only distilled or mineral water. Much of your weight loss will be due to the cleansing properties of the juice. It is estimated one third of the weight lost will be from fat and/or muscle, one third will be water loss, and one third will be fecal and waste matter, which is beneficial as a clean system gives a sense of well being, and allows for a better functioning bowel. I believe whether you decide to make your own juice or buy the original, The Hollywood Diet is a great way to jump start a weight loss program or also to be used as a short detox cleansing diet like for myself. My cleansing soup 1 teaspoon olive oil 2 cloves of garlic, chopped2 tablespoons diced onion 1 inch of fresh ginger, peeled and chopped4 cups fresh broccoli, cut up1/2 pound of fresh spinach leaves 3 parsnips, peeled, chopped2 ribs of celery, trimmed, chopped handful of fresh parsley, Fresh water, tiny pinch of Sea salt and ground pepper, to taste Lemon or lime juice Instructions:Using a large soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat and stir in the garlic, onion, and ginger to season the oil. Add the broccoli, spinach, parsnips, celery and parsley, and stir a bit until the spinach wilts and collapses. Add just enough water to cover the vegetables. Remember the spinach will cook down quite a bit, so don't add too much water at first. You can always thin the soup later, if you need to.Bring to a high simmer, cover the pot, and reduce the heat to a medium simmer. Cook for fifteen minutes or so until the veggies are softened.Use an immersion blender to puree the soup. Serve with NO BREAD! :( When to do the 1 day detox? Well the best time to do this is weekly when there is a change in the Lunar cycle One-day fasting has proven to be a great way to detox your body and improve your immunity. The secret is to juice fast for 24 hours. Only liquids foods may be consumed; and only coinciding with the changes in the moon’s cycle. You must begin the at a specific time when the moon enters a new phase. Within those 24 hours you are not allowed to consume any solid food, but you should drink as much water as possible. You can also drink juice but ONLY freshly squeezed juice without sugar or additives. Alcohol and milk are strictly forbidden. Between 3 and 4 litres (6-8 pints) of liquids should be consumed in the 24 hour period. Within 24 hours you can lose up to 6 lbs if you follow it correctly. There are no possible undesirable effects, if you do begin to feel hungry have a large glass of vegetable juice. The gravity of the moon influences not only oceans and rivers but also body fluids. When the moon changes phases, during the first 24 hours this influence has the greatest potential as it takes 24 hours for the magnetic field of the Earth to change. All this action makes your body let go of it's excess fluids. If you let your body "breathe" for a day, you will lose all the unnecessary water and toxins which are being accumulated in your body as a result of an unhealthy diet, bad digestion and stress. This waste material also makes you gain fat easier. It's important to stress that by following this detox you don't lose fat. You still need to be active and be careful about what you eat. But it is a great way to detox your body and introduce a healthy lifestyle. I'd recommend it as a good introduction to a diet because if you notice a large improvement on the scale in just one day, it will boost your self esteem a lot, which makes losing weight easier. The main thing about this detox is not for weight loss, which is only a pleasant side effect but to detox the body and make you feel light. Since the moon cycle changes once a week, if you practice this diet every week, you can lose and maintain your pcos weight. Of course, you should stick to a balanced diet in between fasting periods with plenty of protein....see my last blog! Next changes in the lunar cycle are 21st Feb 2012, 1st March 2012, 8th, 15th and 22nd March. Give it a go for one day on one of the above dates, see how much you loose the first time? I lost 3lbs my first time, now I ve been following it a while I loose 1lb but it is helping me maintain and keep to my ideal weight for my PCOS. You can do it!
I'm BACK, baby!!! My trusted and busted Pearl Izumi's A day of rest fixed me right up and I felt good enough to get back in the gym today. In my head, all I could hear was my own personal soundtrack 'Back in the Saddle Again' sung personally to me by Aerosmith. (Gah, wouldn't that be a dream come true? Confession: I had a huge crush on Steven Tyler when I was a teenager, which yes, was ages ago. It didn't matter that he was old enough to be my Dad. He was hot!) So, upon reflection of my last visit and it's affect on my back I remembered I'd pushed up the resistance during my time on the stationary bike in the last 5 minutes. Armed with that knowledge, I made sure to stay a bit more aware during those last five minutes on the bike, made some minor adjustments to my posture and how I was pushing my weight through my legs to the pedals. (Another confession, I'm an awful pronator with my feet so pushing my weight through the center of my feet can be challenging. As if any of you wanted to know that. :D) I kept my pace slightly lower on the treadmill and I finished with flying colors. It feels really great to be able to make a recovery with that and not end up in a bad position where I couldn't work out again without an osteopath's assistance.  And, despite my love affair with my trusted and busted Pearl Izumi's, I'm on the hunt for a new pair of trainers. Do you have a favorite brand that you find you go back to over and over? And did you ever have a secret crush on a musician, rock and roll icon, etc etc when you were a teenager? I'd love to hear who yours was. Ciao, xoxo
Spread the rainbow I love rainbows. No, really. However much I wear black and kid myself I'm really cool, I'm a total sucker for anything brightly coloured. Extra points if it's sweet. Which is why these are the first cupcakes I made from scratch, frosted and photographed. I think this cemented my love affair with cupcakes. How can you not love this cupcake? It's simple too. Take a standard white cake recipe, or any light-coloured recipe and add colour. Rainbow Cupcakes Ingredients: 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup butter 2 eggs 2 tsp vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups flour 1 3/4 tsp baking powder 1/2 cup milk + 1/4 cup milk food colouring (red, yellow and blue are fine) Directions: 1. In a medium bowl, cream together sugar and butter. 2. Beat in your eggs one at a time, then stir in your vanilla. 3. Combine flour and baking powder well. Add to mixture and mix well. 4. Stir in 1/2 cup of milk until the batter is smooth. Now, add anything from nothing to an extra 1/4 cup of milk to make it moister. I usually add in a little less than 1/4 cup. Mix until it's smooth. 5. The fun part! Separate the batter into six smaller bowls. It doesn't need to be exact, just roughly the same amount in each bowl. Add in your dye. A lot of food bloggers that have made these recommend gel colouring. I don't know about that, but the liquid food colouring I used worked out perfectly, leaving me with incredibly vibrant colours. I started with half a cap of colouring the first time. Then you can do some adjusting, depending on the shades you want. 6. This is the time consuming part, pouring the batter. (You really don't have to preheat the oven until you're about half or three-quarters way through the cupcake batter. It will have plenty of time to heat up.) Split the purple between the 12 liners and spread so it covers the whole bottom of the liner. Move on to the blue and then all the other colours. While you're spreading the colour, be careful, because if you spread it too vigorously like I did sometimes, you'll go through into the next layer. Not a disaster, but I'd rather my colours stay separate. 7. Preheat oven to 175 C. Grease and flour your tin (or just chuck in some pretty cupcake liners). 8. Bake for 18 minutes and then check on them. They're fairly moist cupcakes. Extremely light cupcakes aren't so good for rainbow-ing. These are done when the top springs back when you poke it lightly. 9. Leave it to cool for a few minutes on a wire rack before taking them all out. Let them cool completely and make your frosting (lemon for me). Best Lemon Frosting Ever. (So far.) Ingredients: 1/2 cup (115g) butter, softened 2 tbsp lemon juice 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 3 cups (375g) icing sugar Directions: Mix everything until smooth! Add in extra lemon juice or icing sugar until you get the intensity and consistency you want. Frost your cupcakes however you want. I just plopped some on with a spoon and spread it. Make sure the cupcakes are cool before frosting. Otherwise the frosting will melt...yes, I do have prior experience with this. Enjoy. (:
A moving type video to brighten your day I don't know about where you are, but it's been pretty awful weather where I am today. I'm talking heavy rain, wind, freezing cold, stormy :/ One of them was a really colourful and animated moving typography animation, it's really good. To be honest it's pretty useless if you watched it to learn the lyrics to the song as the words appear a little out of sync and there's a lot of changing angles and what have you. Here's the link... even if you hate the movie or think the song is lame just watch it anyway, lots of bright colours and cheesy imagery asscoiations. Introducing Me - moving type lyrics Until next time :)  
WEEKLY WEIGH IN! This week has been an eye opener and a fantastic week on plan! I'm currently sat on the sofa, in my onesie watching Family Guy on ITV2 whilst writing this blog to say how proud I am with myself! Before going on my holiday, I was disappointed with my 1.5lb loss as I had gone under my target range. I had followed the plan and my consultant told to increase my healthy extra b to support and maintain my weight. (Unfortunately this didn't work!) Many people have said that I should enjoy myself more and have a takeaway or a big slice of cake! In reality I couldn't, because mentally I was worried about having a gallstone attack if I had a little treat. I haven't had an attack for over a month and I'm due for surgery soon to have my gallbladder removed. I thought why not have a treat on holiday and worry later if I had an attack. Coming home I was straight back onto plan and enjoyed plenty of speed and free food. After my weekly weigh in this week I gained 2.5lb which put me back into my target. Now people were a little confused when I was smiling for putting on but once I told them my situation they sympathised and asked how my week had been. Since coming back off holiday, I have stuck to plan and decreased my healthy extra b back to one to help lose my holiday weight. It was successful! I am now facing the difficult choice of increasing my healthy extra b back up to two as I'm back at target and want to maintain my weight. (Are you at target, if so what do you do?) I hope you've all had a great week this week and are focusing on the week ahead. I know I am! Hayley xxx
